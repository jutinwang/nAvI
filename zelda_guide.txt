When Richard Taylor of New Zealand's Weta Workshop undertook the monumental
task of the production design for the Lord of the Rings films, he gave this
speech to his employees.  Recognizing the significance of this speech, I have
adopted it as my own pledge to the quality of my guides.  God, I'm a nerd.

"If you can't rise to the highest level of enthusiasm, passion, and
professionalism, and grasp this task as if it is the most important thing that
you have ever taken on in your life, you aren't worthy of the task.  We have
been blessed with this opportunity."  - Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop

FAQ/Walkthrough v1.0
July 13th - September 11th, 2006

This guide didn't really take me two months to write.  It was more like two
weeks.  I worked on it intermittently in this two month period, along with my
Killer7 guide, finally sitting down and really hacking away at it around
September 3rd.

This version of the guide is complete and contains the following chapters:
Version Information; Table of Contents; Game Basics; Walkthroughs and
Sidequests; Inventory, Songs, Upgrades and Quest Items; Pieces of Heart; Gold
Skulltulas; Miniboss and Boss Appendix; Frequently Asked Questions; and Legal
Jargon, Links, Contact Information and Special Thanks.  All chapters are
"complete," though I may update them or add additional material as I feel it is
necessary.

It all began in 1986, when a little game known as "The Legend of Zelda" was
released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (or Famicom, for our Japanese
readers).  It's distinctive golden cartridge, battery-backed memory and epic
storyline clearly showed that this was no normal game.  The Legend of Zelda
paved the way for other influential titles, such as Dragon Warrior and Final
Fantasy, which would go on to be critically-acclaimed series themselves, their
roots forgotten as technology advanced.  But it all goes back to The Legend of
Zelda.

The original Zelda was followed in 1989 by Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.
Though a controversial addition to the series, it was nevertheless an important
one.  It's side-scrolling and role-playing elements, and removed emphasis on
Link's inventory clearly showed what worked and what didn't in the series.
When A Link to the Past debuted on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in
1991, it returned to classic Legend of Zelda gameplay.

Though A Link to the Past restored Zelda to it's roots, it took it much
farther.  Link's inventory was tripled, and the overworld of the original
(already modestly large, even by today's standards) was expanded by an
unbelievable factor.  The Legend of Zelda was a hit game; A Link to the Past
pushed Zelda into legendary status.  Even today, almost fifteen years later, A
Link to the Past is still considered one of the greatest games ever produced,
standing up to scrutiny and the tests of time far longer then it's fellows.

Link's first foray into the handheld market was in the critically-acclaimed
"Link's Awakening" for the classic Game Boy.  Amazingly, despite the Game Boy's
limited technological potential, Link's Awakening felt more like a minimized-
version of A Link to the Past instead of a cheap knockoff of the original
Zelda.  The game even made tentative steps to retry Zelda's hand at side-
scrolling, with surprisingly fun results.  As one of the first Game Boy games
to demonstrate that a handheld title could have actual depth and character to
it, Link had proven once again that the Legend of Zelda was the series of
innovation.

The series entered it's longest time of stagnation ever at this point.  It
wasn't until 1997 that The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was released for
the Nintendo 64.  Needless to say, the wait was worth it, as with it's fellows
A Link to the Past and the original Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time was
critically acclaimed and set the standard for what future Action games should
be.  Indeed, Ocarina of Time's pioneering Z-Targeting system was soon copied by
just about every action game on the market.  But, as with so many things ripped
off from competing titles, these adaptations failed miserably.  Even to this
day, the best Z-Targeting is still found in the Zelda Series, and Ocarina of
Time is regularly awarded the title of "Best Game Ever" by gaming publications
worldwide.

Ocarina's enduring gameplay and revolutionary engine has since spawned a
veritable cabbage-industry of knockoffs, safely marking it as every bit as
influential as the original Legend of Zelda.  With the lessons that Nintendo
had learned from Super Mario 64 (itself considered one of the great 3-D
Platforming titles), Zelda had managed to recreate itself for the third time.
Following quickly in Ocarina's footsteps came Majora's Mask, whose rapid
release following Ocarina was attributed largely to the fact that it used the
already created Ocarina game engine.

But that didn't stop Ocarina; it remained one of the best selling games of all
time right to the end of the N64's lifespan.  It has even been re-released not
once, but twice for the Gamecube (once as a bundle in the Zelda Collector's
Edition, and once in the Ocarina of Time/Master Quest bundle with The Wind
Waker).  As if to prove Ocarina's enduring legacy and rabid fanbase, these two
titles are incredibly difficult to find, and have absurd price tags attached to
them when you do.  A used Collector's Edition in good condition will fetch
fifty dollars easily, the same price as a brand new game.

Though The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is nearing it's tenth anniversary
as I write this, it's legacy continues and pervades every action title
imaginable in even the remotest way.  And so I honor the game, the series, and
the legend with this guide, what my own manic ambitions desire to be the
greatest Ocarina of Time guide ever written.

Go me.

Most Zelda games take place in the land of Hyrule, and Ocarina of Time
possesses the most fully realized and complete version of this mythical land.
Like most fictional worlds, Hyrule doesn't try to hide the fact that it is
actually just a smattering of Earthly-locales put together to form a coherent,
living place.  It contains a single forest, a single mountain, a single river,
a single lake, a single plain... you get the idea.

At the start of the game, players take control of Link, a young Kokiri (think
Elves crossed with Hobbits).  The Kokiri live together in a small, protected
section of the Lost Woods known as "The Kokiri Forest."  Ruled by their
benevolent demigod, The Deku Tree, the Kokiri live together in peaceful
harmony.  In the midst of the Lost Woods there is a meadow, the Sacred Forest
Meadow, which some Kokiri are known to visit periodically.  In the midst of
this meadow is the Forest Temple.

North of the Lost Woods is the land of the Zoras.  Ruled over by their King,
and worshipping the immortal fish Jabu-Jabu, the Zoras rule the waters of
Hyrule.  In addition to their mystic fountain and the aquatic caverns that make
their home, the Zora call Zora's River in the east and Lake Hylia in the south
their home.  Deep beneath Lake Hylia lies the Water Temple.

North of Lake Hylia, there exists a rocky, rugged valley that is home to the
Gerudos.  The Gerudos are an earthy, secretive race whose people are mostly
female.  Only a single male Gerudo is born every one hundred years.  Ocarina's
villain, Ganondorf, hails from this land.  Built on the other side of a narrow
canyon, the Gerudo's have a mighty fortress that they call home.  The Fortress
borders along a desert, known only as the Haunted Wasteland.  Hidden in the
midst of the Haunted Wasteland is the Desert Colossus, an ancient oasis and
home of the Gerudos.  The Desert Colossus is actually revealed to be the Spirit
Temple.

In the northeast corner of Hyrule is the village of Kakariko.  Originally a
home to the reclusive Sheikah tribe, with the slow demise of their tribe more
and more Hylians have taken up residence there.  Despite the new presence of
the Hylians, dark secrets of the Sheikah still reside buried beneath the town
and the graveyard behind it.  Kakariko Village is nestled at the foot of Death
Mountain, Hyrule's resident active volcano.  Home to a race of rock-like
creatures known as the Gorons, the mountain is also home to other, more
unpleasant creatures, such as the Dodongos.  The Fire Temple is found in the
middle of Death Mountain's active crater.

To the west of Death Mountain lies Hyrule Castle.  Home to the Hylians, and
Hyrule's namesake, Hyrule Castle contains a Market, and housing for the
citizens of Hyrule and it's Royal Family.  Princess Zelda and her family reside
here as well.  All of Hyrule is connected by a vast, sparsely forested field,
and in the middle of this field is Lon Lon Ranch.  Home to Talon, his daughter
Malon and their assistant, Ingo, Lon Lon Ranch provides the horses that the
Hylians use to cross the field.

In each of the five environments of Hyrule, there exists a Temple which is
aligned to the people of that land.  In the densely forested Lost Woods, there
is the Forest Temple.  In the midst of the burning embers of Death Mountain
Crater, there is the Fire Temple.  Underneath the surface of Lake Hylia is the
Water Temple.  Buried beneath the Kakariko Graveyard is the Shadow Temple.
Deep within the rugged Gerudo Desert is the Spirit Temple.  Aside from these
five mystic temples, home to five of the six Spiritual Sages, there are also
smaller dwellings of evil creatures.

Both the Deku Tree and the Zora Demi-god Jabu-Jabu have been cursed by evil
creatures, and only by traveling into their interiors will Link be able to
defeat the evil monsters and free the Deku Tree and Jabu-Jabu from the
enchantment.  Deep within Death Mountain, there is a cavern where the Gorons
harvest the "Special Crop" that sustains them.  Recently, a pack of ferocious
animals have taken up residence in this cavern, leaving the Gorons starving and
their spirits broken.  Hidden beneath Kakariko Village lies the remnants of an
ancient Sheikah temple, which has been overrun by the undead.  And in the
mystic fountain of the Zoras, there is a frigid cavern which threatens to
destroy the home of the Zora.

With nine dungeons, two mini-dungeons and one optional dungeon, Ocarina of Time
has the largest number of dungeons of any Zelda title, past or present.  Though
they are not as challenging as the dungeons that appeared in Majora's Mask, nor
as lengthy as the dungeons of Wind Waker, the dungeons of Ocarina of Time more
then make up for this by being numerous and diverse.

Each dungeon of the game is built around one central theme - such as the
interior of a fish, or a dungeon based around water or fire - and though there
are numerous puzzles to be solved, each dungeon has one "Big Puzzle" which must
be completed to access the boss and complete the dungeon.

In the game's first dungeon, Inside the Deku Tree, players must open up
passages in the Deku Tree's main chamber, climbing from the Tree's top to it's
bottom, finally reaching the Tree's roots and defeating the parasite that is
sapping it's strength.  In Dodongo's Cavern, players must climb to the top of a
massive Dodongo's skull and force it's mouth open, opening a passage to the
King Dodongo.  In Jabu-Jabu's Belly, players must destroy parasitic tentacles
that sap Jabu-Jabu's strength, finally revealing a path to the parasite in
Jabu-Jabu's brain.

In the Forest Temple, players must track down and kill four elusive Poes who
have stolen magic flames, which open the passage to the boss chamber.  In the
Fire Temple, players must climb clear to the top of the massive structure, in
order to create a bridge to the boss at the bottom of the Temple.  In the Water
Temple, players must proactively raise and lower the water level in the Temple
in order to reach the different areas of the dungeon (a Temple which, may I
add, has irked Ocarina players for over a decade).

In the Shadow Temple, players must cross great expanses of deadly traps in an
almost Indiana Jones-esque environment.  In the Spirit Temple, players have to
travel through time in order to complete both wings of the dungeon.  And
lastly, in Ganon's Castle, players must destroy the six Seals in the Keep.
Each Seal is stored in a room which echoes one of the six Temples of the land
(The Light Temple, which is not an accessible Temple in the game, is also
represented here by the Light Seal).

At the start of Ocarina of Time, Link is a young Kokiri, living amidst the
playful Kokiri tribe.  The Kokiri are completely protected by the benevolent
Deku Tree, who hides the forest from outsiders and protects the Kokiri from the
dangerous monsters of the Lost Woods.  But almost as soon as the game begins,
this fragile protection is shattered by the death of the Deku Tree.  With his
forest home now in danger, Link sets out to fulfill the last wishes of the
Great Deku Tree: To find the Princess of Destiny, and the three Spiritual
Stones, before the Gerudo Thief Ganondorf does.

But after a hearty adventure gathering the Spiritual Stones and covering every
inch of Hyrule with his footsteps, Link discovers that his adventure has only
just begun.  After opening the Door of Time and drawing the Master Sword from
it's pedestal, Young Link immediately finds himself awakening seven years in
the future, and he has become a full-grown Adult.  What's more, thanks to the
magic of the Master Sword and the Ocarina of Time, Link gains the ability to
travel back and forth between his childhood and his adulthood, simply by
visiting the Temple of Time.  He has now truly become the Hero of Time.

Actions that Link performs as a child, be it planting a magic bean, uncovering
a new item, or forging a special bond with a denizen of Hyrule directly affect
the future.  And conversely, knowledge that Link acquires as an adult can be
carried to the past, letting Young Link travel to faraway locales normally
unavailable to him.  This, in turn, lets Young Link perform new actions, plant
new magic beans, uncover new items, forge new special bonds, etc., which then
directly affect the future.  The concept of time travel is deeply ingrained in
Ocarina of Time's gameplay.

On a more technical level, this concept of time travel provides some truly
intriguing twists in the gameplay.  Adult Link, for example, has access to far
more items then Young Link, and his items and weapons are also far more
powerful.  This lets him reach corners of Hyrule completely unreachable with
Young Link.  However, Young Link's smaller size, and the undisturbed peace of
Hyrule in it's prime, let's him access some areas which are closed to Adult
Link.  Mastering the nuances of both versions of Link, and learning when each
one needs to be used to get past certain obstacles, lets the player reach
hidden Heart Pieces and Gold Skulltulas.

A Link to the Past, this is due more to the fact that Ocarina doesn't have
quite as many superfluos items that you use once, and then forget they exist.
In a nutshell, Ocarina has fewer items then Link to the Past, but they are used
better, so we forgive them.

All of Link's classic items from previous games return - the Bow and Arrows and
Bombs, a staple since the original title, return in all their glory.  The now-
famous Hookshot from A Link to the Past, arguably the most brilliantly
conceived item in the entire series, returns for Ocarina, reworked for it's
three dimensional environment.  Even A Link to the Past's oft-ignored Magic
Hammer returns for Ocarina, though this time around it has become the Megaton
Hammer, and is so massive even Adult Link has difficulty in wielding it.  New
items in the series include the unorthodox and under-utilized Bombchus (which
crawl along walls and ceilings in a straight line before finally exploding),
and the Lens of Truth (which reveals things for what they truly are, making the
invisible visible, and the fake disappear).

In A Link to the Past, Link had upgradeable equipment, but never on the level
that appears in Ocarina.  Obtaining new Armor in A Link to the Past enhanced
Link's defense.  In Ocarina, new tunics grant Link the ability to breath
underwater or withstand tremendous heat, and the player can change between
available tunics at will.  Also in A Link to the Past, upgrading Link's sword
or shield to their next level was a permanent upgrade.  In Ocarina, players can
choose which sword or shield they choose to wield, as each provides unique
advantages and disadvantages for both Young Link and Adult Link.

The Kokiri Sword, which is little more then a large knife, is the only weapon
small enough for Young Link to brandish.  But as Adult Link, players can choose
to use the Master Sword, or the Biggoron's Sword.  The Master Sword is a sturdy
weapon, which is light enough to wield with a shield.  The Biggoron's Sword, on
the other hand, is so massive that Adult Link can't use a shield while wielding
it, and has such a wide reach that the blade is impossible to use in narrow
corridors.  Even the way Young Link and Adult Link use the Hylian Shield is
markedly different.  Though both can equip the shield, it is too big for Young
Link to actually use, and he instead has to resort to hiding under it like a
shell.

Music has been a staple of the series since it's inception, and has slowly
developed over the ever-expanding list of titles.  In the original Legend of
Zelda, the Magic Flute was used to warp around the Hyrule Overworld, and was
even instrumental in defeating certain bosses.  In Zelda II: The Adventure of
Link, the flute had a much reduced but still significant role in defeating
enemies.  A Link to the Past saw the Magic Flute (still called a Flute, even
though by that time it had evolved fully into the Ocarina we know today) being
used to summon a helpful bird that would carry Link to different corners of
Hyrule.  Link's Awakening saw the first introduction of multiple songs
available for the Flute, but Ocarina of Time takes the magical flute and turns
it from novelty item into full-blown musical instrument.

Though the Ocarina is just that: an Ocarina, the different songs that can be
played on it are key to finishing the game.  One of the first songs you learn,
Zelda's Lullaby, is used by Young Link to show his allegiance to the Hyrule
Royal Family to the Gorons and Zoras, and is later used by Adult Link in the
dungeons and other hidden locations of Hyrule.  Epona's Song is the only way to
obtain Epona, Link's legendary horse.  The Sun's Song possesses the power to
turn day into night, and night into day.  The Song of Storm's can summon storms
to Link's location.

But the Ocarina is used more then to just play music; later, he can use it to
travel instantaneously between different locations in Hyrule.  This is pivotal
in allowing Young Link to bypass certain obstacles (such as an impassable
barrier of rock, or particularly stubborn guards) and reach some of the more
elusive locales in Hyrule.  Though the Ocarina seems a small and seemingly
expendable trinket, it's one of the most endearing and important items in the
game.

At the start of his journey, Link is joined by a Fairy called Navi.  Navi, sent
specially to Link by the Deku Tree, acts as his friend and companion through
his adventure.  Though sometimes annoyingly persistent in calling Link's
attention (Hey!  Hey!  Listen!  Hey!), Navi nevertheless performs a pivotal
action in the game: Z-Targeting.

Constantly copied by Zelda's competitors, but never as faithfully or
brilliantly conceived as it appears in the Zelda series, Z-Targeting allows
Link to focus his attention on a single target, and radically alters his
moveset to focus on combat.  While in free-form camera mode, the A Button makes
Link interact with objects in his environment.  While Z-Targeted, however, it
causes Link to perform different jumping actions.  Jumping to the left or right
will strafe in a circle around the enemy, while a backwards jump will make Link
do a backflip.  A jump while holding forward causes Link to perform the Jump
Attack, the most powerful attack in his repertoire.

While in free-form camera mode, the R Button activates Link's shield.  However,
it also makes him completely stationary.  While Z-Targeted, however, holding
the R button will tell Link to raise his shield, but he still maintains his
mobility.  Even the Sword's attacks change while Z-Targeted.  While in free-
form mode, tapping the B Button will cause Link to perform a sideways, sweeping
attack.  While Z-Targeted, however, this attack becomes a downward plunge.
Holding forward and B will cause Link to stab, or a whole new assortment of
cool attacks.  Even Prince of Persia's "Free-Form Fighting System" isn't nearly
as flexible or fun as Ocarina's Z-Targeted battles... at least in this author's
opinion.

Mastering the nuances of blocking with the shield, dodging with different
jumping maneuvers, and attacking in many different methods provides a unique,
simple, yet engaging combat experience, one which few other action games in
existence can challenge.

Like so many concepts that just plain worked since the original title, Zelda
games are filled with lots of optional upgrades to find to enhance Link.
Though in the original game this was limited to four hidden Heart Containers in
the Overworld, since then the hidden items have grown to include the
quintessential Pieces of Heart, the always-elusive Fourth Bottle, and usually
some kind of hidden item to be gathered for rewards.  This started in Link's
Awakening with the Secret Seashells, and Ocarina of Time continues that
tradition with one hundred Gold Skulltulas hidden throughout Hyrule.

Hidden in both time periods of the game in roughly equal portions, the Gold
Skulltulas are the symbols of a curse that affects a wealthy family in Kakariko
Village.  There are six members in the family total, and finding, destroying,
and taking the magic token from enough Gold Skulltulas will free one of the
family members from his curse.  Visiting the House of Skulltula at that point
will get Link some kind of special item, usually beneficial, sometimes
laughably useless.  Finding all one hundred Gold Skulltulas is perhaps the most
ominously difficult task in the game, as some of them require absurd amounts of
backtracking (sometimes even returning to previously completed dungeons) to
track them down.

Ocarina also honors it's predecessors with the inclusion of thirty-six hidden
Pieces of Heart.  Each Piece of Heart represents one-quarter of a Heart
Container, and gathering four Pieces of Heart rewards the player with an
additional Heart Container.  With thirty-six total Pieces of Heart hidden
around Hyrule, that amounts to nine of the game's twenty available Heart
Containers from Pieces of Heart.

Both Gold Skulltulas and Pieces of Heart are hidden in both periods of Link's
life, and some of the more fiendishly difficult ones actually require the
player to accomplish goals in both time periods to reach them.  But, in typical
Nintendo fashion, these goals are never so perplexing or challenging as to be
overly annoying to complete.  A 100% completed Ocarina of Time game file is
truly something to be proud of.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time marks a milestone in gaming.  Just as the
original Legend of Zelda set the standard for what Adventure Games - nay, what
video games in general should have been, the Ocarina of Time does the same for
it's generation of gaming.  Doubtless, the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: The
Twilight Princess will once again place that bar of competence to an even
higher mark (Post-Twilight Princess update: it didn't.  Good game, though).
With it's new concepts and reworked old ideas constantly recycled into other
games, there's no denying Ocarina of Time's timeless appeal and huge influence.
It's not unusual for new game developers to cite The Legend of Zelda as the
reason they got involved in video game programming, and in another ten years we
will probably hear similar stories told about Ocarina of Time.  It's not just
Zelda; it's the Legend.

I'm getting a little melodramatic now, so... on with the Walkthrough.

     Main Adventure
This is the complete guide to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.  It covers
the entire game, beginning to end, room for room, in high detail.  All Gold
Skulltula Tokens and Pieces of Heart are pointed out, and strategies are given
for fighting the major enemies or maneuvering through the dungeons and
overworld.  If you're looking for a 100% completion rating, then this is the
Walkthrough you're looking for.

A Note on Organization:  Each part of the walkthrough is divided into areas for
ease of use.  To recognize when one area ends and another begins, look for the
line of hyphens (-).  At the beginning of each area's section, if there are new
songs, items or upgrades to be found, then it will be pointed out.  New areas
are generally separated by a "fade out" or "cut" of the in-game camera.

A Note on the Passage of Time:  If you need to be in an area at a certain time
of day, then it will be specified in that area's heading in the guide.  If it
doesn't matter what time of day it is, then there will be no time stamp on the
heading.

A Note on [GSXXX] Find Codes: These are special find codes used in conjunction
with the Gold Skulltula chapter, and do not affect the main walkthrough.  They
can be safely ignored.

A Note on [HPXX] Find Codes: These are special find codes used in conjunction
with the Heart Piece chapter, and do not affect the main walkthrough.  They can
be safely ignored.

-------------
Introduction

The chapters in this guide's walkthrough follows the "preferred progression"
for the game, and is written in such a way that it assumes that you have items
that are covered in previous chapters, and do not have items that appear in
future chapters.  However, there are multiple paths which can be taken through
the game once you finish the game's first three dungeons and become Adult Link.
More advanced players may want to add variety to the game by completing Adult
Link's adventures in different orders.  That's what this chapter is for; it
contains the different progressions you can choose to make it through the game.

-------
Step I

The game's beginning, and first three dungeons, are always the same, and when
you first reach adulthood, you MUST obtain the Hookshot before you can do
anything else.  Once you have Epona, you can complete the Biggoron Sword
Sidequest at ANY time.  Therefore, the first part of ANY game progression
always follows this chapter order:

Kokiri Forest
Dungeon I: Inside the Deku Tree
Hyrule Castle
Lon Lon Ranch and the Lost Woods
Kakariko Village
Death Mountain
Dungeon II: Dodongo's Cavern
Return to Death Mountain and Hyrule Castle
Zora River, Zora's Domain, Lake Hylia and Gerudo Valley
Dungeon III: Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly
  Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (optional)
Finishing Up Childhood
Return to Lon Lon Ranch and Kakariko Village
  Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest (optional)

--------
Step II

However, from there you have some flexibility.  The Fire Temple and Ice Cavern
can both be completed without the Fairy Bow from the Forest Temple, just as the
Ice Cavern and Forest Temple can be completed without the Megaton Hammer from
the Fire Temple, and the Fire Temple and Forest Temple can be completed without
the Iron Boots from the Ice Cavern.  And if you're done with the Ice Cavern and
the Forest Temple, then you can proceed to the Water Temple before finishing
the Fire Temple. Additionally, once you finish the Forest Temple and have the
Fairy Bow, and once you have Epona, then the Gerudo Fortress CAN be completed
at ANY time (though this guide will wait until you HAVE to do it).  Also, once
you have completed the Forest Temple, you can return to your childhood at any
time, at which point The Bottom of the Well also becomes available.  Lastly,
the Big Poe Hunting sidequest can be completed at any time after obtaining
Epona and getting the Fairy Bow.  Did you get all that?  So, the next "phase"
of the game can take any one of these different progressions:

Progression One:
Return to Kokiri Forest and the Lost Woods
Dungeon IV: The Forest Temple
  Return to Gerudo Valley (optional)
  Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (optional)
  Big Poe Hunting (optional)
Return to Death Mountain and Death Mountain Crater
Dungeon V: The Fire Temple
Return to Zora's Domain
Mini-Dungeon: The Ice Cavern
Return to Lake Hylia
Dungeon VI: The Water Temple
After the Water Temple...

Progression Two:
Return to Death Mountain and Death Mountain Crater
Dungeon V: The Fire Temple
Return to Kokiri Forest and the Lost Woods
Dungeon IV: The Forest Temple
  Return to Gerudo Valley (optional)
  Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (optional)
  Big Poe Hunting (optional)
Return to Zora's Domain
Mini-Dungeon: The Ice Cavern
Return to Lake Hylia
Dungeon VI: The Water Temple
After the Water Temple...

Progression Three:
Return to Zora's Domain
Mini-Dungeon: The Ice Cavern
Return to Death Mountain and Death Mountain Crater
Dungeon V: The Fire Temple
Return to Kokiri Forest and the Lost Woods
Dungeon IV: The Forest Temple
  Return to Gerudo Valley (optional)
  Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (optional)
  Big Poe Hunting (optional)
Return to Lake Hylia
Dungeon VI: The Water Temple
After the Water Temple...

Progression Four:
Return to Zora's Domain
Mini-Dungeon: The Ice Cavern
Return to Kokiri Forest and the Lost Woods
Dungeon IV: The Forest Temple
  Return to Gerudo Valley (optional)
  Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (optional)
  Big Poe Hunting (optional)
Return to Lake Hylia
Dungeon VI: The Water Temple
After the Water Temple...
Return to Death Mountain and Death Mountain Crater
Dungeon V: The Fire Temple

Progression Five:
  Biggoron Sword Trading Sequence (optional)
Return to Death Mountain and Death Mountain Crater
Dungeon V: The Fire Temple
Return to Zora's Domain
Mini-Dungeon: The Ice Cavern
Return to Kokiri Forest and the Lost Woods
Dungeon IV: The Forest Temple
  Return to Gerudo Valley (optional)
  Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (optional)
  Big Poe Hunting (optional)
Return to Lake Hylia
Dungeon VI: The Water Temple
After the Water Temple...

---------
Step III

Once you have finished any one of these five progressions, then you can go to
either the Shadow Temple or the Spirit Temple.  Before the Shadow Temple can be
completed, however, then the Bottom of the Well Mini-Dungeon MUST be completed.
And before the Spirit Temple can even be attempted, BOTH the Bottom of the Well
and the Gerudo Fortress must be completed.  You can also do the first half of
the Spirit Temple, then run off to do the Shadow Temple, then do the second
half of the Spirit Temple, if you choose.  Therefore, the progression can
follow any of these patterns:

Progression One:
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)

Progression Two:
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple

Progression Three:
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)

Progression Four:
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)

Progression Five:
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple

Progression Six:
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)

Progression Seven:
Return to Gerudo Valley (if not previously completed)
Mini-Dungeon: Bottom of the Well (if not previously completed)
After The Well...
Crossing the Haunted Wasteland
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part I (Young Link)
Spirit Temple Interlude
Dungeon VIII: The Spirit Temple, Part II (Adult Link)
Dungeon VII: The Shadow Temple

--------
Part IV

The last part of the game is always the game's final dungeon: Ganon's Tower.
With these progression charts, then you can replay the game in interesting and
unorthodox patterns.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

-----------------------
Name Registration Page

Begin the game by entering your name into the Name Registration Page, then
select the new entry from the menu.

-------------
Introduction

Watch the introduction, which introduces the game's main characters.  Once Navi
the Fairy has awoken Link from his nightmare, then the game has truly begun.

------------------
Link's Tree House

Head out the door in the northwest corner.

--------------
Kokiri Forest
New Equipment: Kokiri Sword

On Link's porch, you will be approached by Saria, one of the game's more
important sub characters.  Jump down the ladder and speak to her.  Follow the
road from Saria north, and then to the east.  Jump across the small pool of
water to the large arch that leads to the Great Deku Tree.  Speak with Mido,
the Kokiri who blocks your path.  He'll refuse to let you pass until you find
both a Sword and Shield (a task which he thinks is impossible, but we'll soon
prove otherwise).

Turn around and return to the area near Link's Tree House.  Go west along the
path, then take a right up the hill.  Enter the fenced in area (which is known
collectively as the Kokiri Training Ground), and work your way to the back to
the south wall.  Enter the small tunnel by standing in front of it and pressing
A.  Crawl to the tunnel's other side.

On the other side, turn left.  Wait until you see a large boulder roll by you,
then immediately follow the boulder's path around the corner to the right, then
another left, then take another right.  Open the treasure chest sitting on the
tree trunk to find the Kokiri Sword.  Equip it on your Equipment submenu.  Next
item on your list is a Shield, which you'll have to buy from the shop for 40
rupees.  There is also a Deku Stick Expansion which can be bought in the Lost
Woods, which also costs 40 rupees.  So your goal, at the moment, is to find 80
rupees.

Slash the bush behind the chest, which may drop a rupee.  Turn around, and wait
for the boulder to roll by.  Run left and into the small alcove.  Take the blue
rupee and slash the bush, and take the rupee that it may or may not drop.  Turn
around, and wait for the boulder to roll by again.  Run left around the corner,
then another left.  Take the blue rupee in the far alcove, then slash the bush
which should (hopefully) yield another Rupee.  Crawl back into the tunnel and
return to the Kokiri Training Ground.

On the outside of the tunnel, Z-Target one of the rocks to the left.  Begin
performing backflips (hold back and press A) over and over until you reach the
edge of the training ground.  Run back towards the rock and repeat the
backflips until you are awarded a blue rupee and a green rupee.  Slash all of
the bushes near the entrance to the Training Ground and take the rupees they
should drop.  From the entrance of the Training Ground, look north.  The giant
tree stump before you is Mido's House.  Go inside.

-------------
Mido's House

Open all of his chests for 11 rupees and a Recovery Heart.  After you've robbed
Mido blind, leave his house.

--------------
Kokiri Forest

Jump up to the ledge behind Mido's House, and look behind his house to find
another Blue Rupee.  From where you emerge from Mido's House, look to the left
to see a number of platforms resting in the water.  Run directly at these
platforms, and run across them.  Link will automatically jump from each one as
you run along them.  If you do it properly, after you have reached the opposite
shore of the water you will receive a blue rupee.  Repeat this in the opposite
direction to receive another blue rupee.

You've now obtained all of the blue rupees which are preset in the game.  The
rest must be obtained randomly from the Kokiri Children's houses or from the
bushes around Kokiri Forest.  The house in the southeast corner has the most
rupees (six, look in the pots), and leaving then entering the house repeatedly
will respawn the pots.  Keep gathering these rupees until you have 80.
Entering and leaving the houses will also respawn the rupees you can obtain by
jumping across the platforms along the pond.

Try to enter the building in the northeast corner of Kokiri Forest.  You will
be stopped by a girl sitting on a balcony, who will give you a basic lesson in
Z-Targeting.  Follow her instructions if you need to learn, then enter the
building.

------------
Kokiri Shop
New Equipment: Deku Shield

Purchase a Deku Shield from the clerk.  Equip it on the Equipment Submenu, then
leave the shop.

--------------
Kokiri Forest

Head back to Mido's House in the northwest corner of the Kokiri Forest, then
climb up on the ledge behind his house.  Look for the wall covered in vines,
then climb the vines to the top.  Work your way around along the ledge and
enter the large hollow log to enter the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Equipment: Deku Stick Maximum Capacity Upgrade #1

We'll be returning here several times over the course of the game, but you
won't be able to do much on this first visit.  Head left through the log.
Ignore the two elevated logs; we'll get to them in the next visit.  Head
through the hollowed out log in the left corner of this area.

Take note of the patch of soft earth here; it will be semi-important later.
Jump off the ledge to the floor below, and make your way to the back of the
area.  Z-Target the Business Scrub, who will probably retreat into the ground.
Scrubs like to hide in the ground when you get too close to them.  If you stand
far enough away, though, they will reemerge and begin firing Deku Nuts at you.
To beat this Business Scrub and make him sell you his wares, either reflect his
Deku Nut back into his face with the Deku Shield, or do a Jump Attack.

To perform a jump attack, begin by drawing your sword (B button) then hitting
A.  If you time it right and stand at just the right distance, the tip of your
sword will connect with the Business Scrub just before he retreats into the
ground.  Speak with him, and he will upgrade the total amount of Deku Sticks
you can carry to 20 for 40 rupees (and he'll maximize your Deku Sticks for
free).

Return to the opposite side of the valley and climb the ladder back to the top.
Go through the hollowed log, then hang a right into another hollowed log.  Go
left or right (it doesn't matter which) through another hollowed log to return
to the Kokiri Forest.

--------------
Kokiri Forest

Head to the east side of the area, back across the pond, and speak with Mido
again.  Now that you've lived up to his challenge to find a Sword and Shield,
he'll let you pass.  But he won't be happy about it.  With Mido out of the way,
enter the passage.  Halfway through it, you'll encounter a bunch of Deku Babas.
These guys die in one hit from your sword, and leave behind Deku Sticks.  Kill
them or dodge them, whichever you prefer, and make your way through to the Deku
Tree's Clearing.

The Deku Tree will test Link and Navi, by having them enter his uh... mouth,
and defeat the parasite that has been placed at his roots.  Enter his mouth to
begin the first dungeon.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The game's first Dungeon, Inside the Deku Tree, follows one of the simplest
formulas of all of the dungeons in the game.  The main body of the dungeon is
the interior of the Great Deku Tree's trunk, and all of the other rooms in the
dungeon stretch out from this central area.  The Trunk has four main levels:
The Top Floor, The Main Floor, The Basement, and the Sub-Basement.  In order to
progress through the dungeon, you must find a way to break through the four
different levels of the Trunk and into the Sub-Basement, where the dungeon's
boss resides.

---------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - The Trunk
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

Start by killing the Deku Babas in the corners of the room.  Hold your shield
up with R while Z-Targeting to absorb their attacks.  Take the Deku Sticks
and/or Deku Nuts that they drop.  Slash the bushes against the northeastern
wall, then climb up the ivy wall in the northern part of the room.  Slash the
bushes at the top, then run to the right along the platform, being careful not
to fall.  Open the chest part of the way along the ledge to find the Dungeon
Map.  Keep going right along the ledge and enter the door you come to.

-------------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Scrub Room #1

Defeat the Deku Scrub by Z-Targeting him and reflecting the Deku Nut he fires
back into his face.  The Scrub will then get up and start running around the
room.  Don't chase him; go and stand on his nest.  When the Scrub attempts to
return to his nest, he will walk right into you.  He will then open both of the
doors in the room, and give you a useful hint for avoiding fall damage (press
forward on the joystick as you land).  Go northeast through the door to the
next room.

--------------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Slingshot Room
New Item: Fairy Slingshot
New Equipment: Bullet Bag x30

Jump out to the gray platform, but quickly jump to the next ledge, as the
platform will quickly begin to fall.  Open the chest to find the Fairy
Slingshot (and the Bullet Bag x30 which goes with it, though it isn't mentioned
in-game).  Turn to the right and climb the ivy wall.  Open the chest for a
Recovery Heart.  Turn around and look down, towards the door that you came in.
Using the Fairy Slingshot, shoot down the ladder that hangs above the door.
Jump down and climb up the ladder, then go back through the door.  Return to
the Trunk through Scrub Room #1.

---------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - The Trunk

Go back along the ledge to where you opened the chest for the Dungeon Map.  Use
the Slingshot to shoot down the three Skullwalltullas clinging to the ivy wall.
Once they are out of the way, climb the wall to the top, and then to the left
to reach the highest level of the Deku Tree.

Jump off the ivy wall when you are over the top ledge.  Ignore the Big
Skulltulas who drop down, and keep going to the left until you reach a door.
Go through it.

------------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Compass Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS001]
New Dungeon Item: Compass

Turn to the right and step on the switch next to the lantern.  The three
platforms in the center of the room will begin to rise.  Quickly jump along
them to the ledge in the back of the room.  Open the chest to find the Compass.
Kill the Deku Baba for a Deku Stick if you don't have one (you're going to need
one in a moment).  Drop back down off the cliff and return to the room's
entrance.  Use the ivy wall in the northwest corner to climb back up.

Step on the switch again, and this time use the platforms to reach the small
alcove in the northern part of the room.  Jump past the Big Skulltula and open
the chest for a Recovery Heart.  Kill the Gold Skulltula in the back of the
alcove to get the game's first Gold Skulltula Token.  Skulltula Tokens can be
redeemed at the House of Skulltula in Kakariko Village for rewards.  Some
rewards are good, some are just plain awful.  You won't be able to Z-target the
Skulltula - this is normal.  The tokens, however, are Z-targetable.

Jump back down to the pit in the center of the room, and climb back up to the
door.  Use a Deku Stick near the lantern, and it will catch on fire.  Use the
flaming Deku Stick to light the burned out lantern, and the door will unlock.
Go through the door.

---------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - The Trunk
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS002] [GS003]

Run to the right, past the first Big Skulltula.  When you reach the second one,
kill it by Z-Targeting it, and waiting for it to spin around.  Use a Jump
Attack when it does this.  You're now going to have to jump off the edge and
land on the bit of webbing, clear down on the first floor of the Trunk.  It may
take a few tries to get your aim precise, but it isn't difficult.  If you land
right on the webbing, you will break through it into the sub basement level of
the Trunk.

You'll land in a pool of water.  Climb up onto the ledge in the southeast
corner of the room (to your right as you land).  Step on the switch to activate
the lantern.  Use your Fairy Slingshot to kill the Gold Skulltula on the
grating on the eastern side of the room.  Jump out from the ledge to reach it,
then climb back up onto the ledge.  Face the long ivy wall that you fell down
to reach this area, on the south side of the room.  Kill the second Gold
Skulltula, and climb up the wall to claim the token.

Climb back up onto the southeast ledge once more, and open the chest behind the
lantern to find a Recovery Heart.  Light a Deku Stick on the lantern, then
quickly jump out onto the pond so that you land on the shallow bit which Link
can stand on without having to swim.  From there, jump to the southwest ledge,
run past the Deku Baba and use the flaming Deku Stick to burn the webs on the
wall, revealing a door.  Go through this door.

-------------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Scrub Room #2

Defeat the Scrub in this room by deflecting the Deku Nuts he fires back at him
with your Deku Shield (the Slingshot doesn't work, he just retreats back into
the ground).  Once he starts running around the room, run to his nest and stand
on it.  When he tries to return to his nest, he'll run right into you, thus
defeating him.  He'll mention that "23 is number 1," which is actually a hint
to solve the last puzzle before the boss.

Shoot the Silver Eye above the west door with the Fairy Slingshot to unlock the
door.  Go through the door to the next room.

---------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Trap Room

In this room there is a large floating platform which passes over the pool of
water you need to get over.  The catch is, there is also a large spinning pole
covered with spikes which blocks the platform's path.  To circumvent this
obstacle, jump into the pool.  On the left side of the pool, against the wall,
directly beneath the rotating spikes, there is a button.  Swim over this
button, then press and hold down A to swim down and touch the switch.

Once the switch is activated, the water level in the pool will lower
considerably.  Quickly swim back to the room's entrance, and jump out to the
floating platform.  Hold down the R button to make Link crouch as you pass
under the rotating spikes.  On the other side of the pool, jump from the
floating platform to the opposite ledge.

Kill the Big Skulltula, then move to the left side of the large stone block.
Follow Navi's instructions to push the block all the way to the right, then
jump up onto the block, then jump up to the door.  Go through the door.

----------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Torch Room

Kill the Deku Baba in the center of the room, then light a Deku Stick on the
lit torch.  Use the flame to light the two un-lit sconces, which will open the
door in the north side of the room.  Go through it.

----------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Small Nest

Kill the Big Skulltula, then run to the center of the room.  Run around in
circles in the center of the room, which will provoke the Gohma Larva hanging
from the ceiling to drop down.  Kill them with single Jump Attacks, but avoid
their charge attack.  You know they are about to perform this when their eye
turns red.

Ignore the bit of webbing in the northeast corner; we'll get to it later in the
game.  We can't do much there at the moment.  Light a Deku Stick on the torches
near the north part of the room, and use the lit Deku Stick to burn the webbing
in the south part of the room.  Enter the tunnel and crawl through to the other
side.

---------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - The Trunk

Run to the left, and push the stone block along it's carved path and off the
cliff.  Jump down, and go back to the southeast platform with the torch.  Light
a Deku Stick on the torch, then jump back to the stone block.  Climb back up to
the upper level, then run to the webbing covering the floor.  Roll over the
webbing by running at it and pressing A.  The torch will make contact with the
webbing as you roll, burning it away.  Drop down the new hole to the lowest
level.

You will land in a pool of water.  Swim north to the shore, where three Deku
Scrubs will attack you.  If you remember the hint from Scrub Room #2, then this
will be an easy puzzle.  If you forgot, or weren't paying attention, then you
have to kill them in order.  The middle one is first, the one on the far right
goes second, and the one on the left goes last.  Striking the first two will
only stun them; the last one, however, will run around the room just like the
previous Deku Scrubs you've fought.  After you hit him, run and stand on his
nest.  When he tries to return, he'll bump into you and give up.  He'll also
let slip the Dungeon Boss' secret: she is only vulnerable while stunned.

After the three Deku Scrubs have disappeared, the door will unlock.  Go through
to the game's first boss.

-------------B-O-S-S-------------
Parasitic Armored Arachnid GOHMA
New Upgrade: Heart Container
New Quest Item: Kokiri Emerald

Run to the center of the room, then go into First-Person view (C Up) and look
towards the ceiling to begin the boss fight.

Fighting Gohma is actually very similar to fighting a gigantic Gohma Larva.
The only real tricks she has over these basic enemies is considerably more
health, the ability to climb walls, and the ability to create Gohma Larva to
distract you.  Defeating Gohma is rather easy (and can, in fact, be done by
only stunning her twice if you know how to do it properly).  To stun Gohma and
make her vulnerable to basic sword attacks, you must shoot her in the eye with
the Slingshot while her eye glows red.
As soon as the fight begins, immediately Z-target Gohma.  Gohma usually
immediately begins her charge attack, so immediately shoot her in the eye with
the Slingshot, then begin using Jump Attacks (remember to swing your sword at
least once before trying to do a jump attack).  After one or two attacks, Gohma
will run away and crawl up the ceiling.

Keeping Gohma Z-Targeted, try to keep yourself positioned so that you can see
her eye even while she is on the ceiling.  At this point she will begin
spawning Gohma Larva, who will drop down to fight you.  If you can shoot her in
the eye before she is able spawn them, however, then she will fall to the floor
and be stunned for a VERY long time.  You can easily get in three or four more
Jump Attacks at this point, which are more then enough to shut down Gohma
permanently.  If you miss, then kill the Gohma Larva, at which point the boss'
pattern resets.

After Gohma is dead, take the Heart Container that she leaves behind, and enter
the shimmering blue circle.  You will be teleported back outside the Deku Tree,
who will ask you to listen to his story.  Agree, and listen to the story (pay
attention; it's very important to the game's overall storyline).  Afterwards he
will inform you that even though you were successful in defeating Gohma, he is
still going to die.  He gives Link the Kokiri Emerald, and makes one final
wish: to seek out the other Spiritual Stones and prevent the "Evil Man from the
Desert" (Ganondorf) from entering the Sacred Realm.  As his last piece of
advice, the Deku Tree tells Link to go to Hyrule Castle and seek out the
Princess of Destiny.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

--------------
Kokiri Forest

You will emerge back near the entrance to the Kokiri Forest township.  Mido is
once again blocking your path, so speak to him.  Mido will blame you for the
Deku Tree's death, the take off, presumably to sulk somewhere.  Jump across the
lake and follow the path to the western edge of Kokiri Forest.  The Kokiri who
originally blocked your path here is now gone, so you can exit through the
hollowed log.  Go through to leave the Kokiri Forest.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Item: Fairy Ocarina

As you pass over the bridge leading to Hyrule Field, you will come across
Saria.  She accepts that Link is leaving, and gives him the Fairy Ocarina as a
parting gift.  The game will automatically zone you into the next area.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Take a few steps forward, and simultaneously the best and most annoying
character in the game will stop you: Kaepora Gaebora.  He'll explain how to get
to Hyrule Castle, and also how your map works.  Make sure you tell him "Yes,"
you got all that, unless you want him to repeat the entire spiel.

Once KG flies away, run forward between the trees where the beginnings of a
road appear.  Follow the road to it's end to reach Hyrule Castle.  Make sure
you roll all the way (by continually pressing the A button as you run),
otherwise it will be night time by the time you reach Hyrule Castle, and the
gates will be closed.  At which point you'll have to sit around for the next
few minutes waiting for time to pass.

-------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)

Once you gain access to Hyrule Castle, immediately enter the gatehouse to your
left as you enter.

--------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Gatehouse (daytime) [GS004]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1

Smash all of the pots in this room with your sword, then destroy the crates in
the rear of the room by rolling into them.  One of them contains a Gold
Skulltula.  Kill it, and take the token it leaves behind.  Then leave the
Gatehouse.

-------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge (daytime)

Go southwest to the next area.

---------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

Head around to the opposite side of the fountain, and speak with the little
girl in the white dress.  This is Malon, another important bit character.
After you've spoken with Malon, enter the building behind her with the large
target over the door.

-------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Shooting Gallery (daytime)
New Equipment: Bullet Bag x40

Speak with the rather large and hairy clerk, and agree to play the game.  To
win the Big Bullet Bag, you have to shoot every rupee that appears without
missing a single one.  If you miss two or less, then the clerk will let you try
again for free.  If you miss more then two, you have to pay to play again.

For this first run through the Shooting Gallery, the rupees appear in a preset
order.  The order is:

1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Keep playing the minigame until you successfully shoot all of the targets, and
the clerk will award you with the Bullet Bag x40, which increases the ammo
capacity of your Slingshot by 10.  If you run out of rupees trying to complete
the game, then return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse and smash the pots to
replenish your supplies.

Bullet Bag in hand, return to the Market.

---------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

Leave the market through the passage directly behind Malon.

-----------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Garden (daytime) [GS005]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1

Run forward a short ways, where Kaepora Gaebora will appear again.  Listen to
his rant about guards, then when he flies away roll into his tree to make a
Gold Skulltula appear.  Now, you'll have to hang around here until it becomes
nighttime.  Once it does, head back to the Market.

-----------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market (nighttime)

Run back around, towards the entrance to the Market from the Drawbridge.  Run
behind the little stall to the left, and you should coax a small white dog into
following you.  If you accidentally attract the attention of another dog, leave
the area and re-enter it.  Once you have the dog following you, run to the
right and into the alley in the far right corner.

---------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Back Alley (nighttime)

Enter the door second on your left.

---------------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Little Richard's House (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP01]

Speak with the big fat lady in this house, and she will recognize the lost dog
as her own.  She'll reward you with a Piece of Heart for finding Little Richard
(good golly, miss molly!).  Go back out to the Back Alley and return to the
Garden.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Garden
New Item: Weird Egg, Chicken

Malon should now be standing near a long vine on the wall to your right.  If
she isn't standing there, then you didn't speak with her back in the Market.
You'll have to return there, speak to her again, then return to the Garden and
wait for another Day/Night cycle to pass, then return to the Market, then
return to the Garden, where Malon should have appeared.

Speak with Malon, and she'll explain that her father, Talon, went to the castle
to deliver Milk, but hasn't returned yet.  He probably fell asleep somewhere
around the castle, and she asks that you go and find him.  There's a catch,
though; the guards in the Garden won't look to kindly upon some kid in a green
fairy costume sneaking into the castle grounds.  If they spot you, they'll grab
you and throw you back outside the gate.  Malon also gives you an Egg, for no
apparent reason.  You'll need the Chicken inside the egg to wake Talon,
however, so accept it with gratitude.

Climb up the ivy wall to the top (it has some rough spots where if you don't
climb up in just the right place, you'll fall off).  At the top, run forward a
bit, past the gossip stone, to the top of the large marble arch.  Drop down to
the ground on the other side of the arch, where you will land on the other side
of the gate which formerly blocked your path.  You probably don't realize it,
but you've already snuck past two of the guards.

This next part is the easily the hardest part of sneaking through the Garden.
You need to run up the hill to the left at an exact angle.  There are three
graphical breaks in the hill (thank god for N64's visible sprites, otherwise
this would be nearly impossible to describe).  The place you need to run up is
the third break in the hill, approximately near it's center.  Go straight up
the hill, and at the top there is a cluster of flowers.  Run straight at these
flowers, then begin running forward and slightly to the left until you reach a
wall.  Part of the wall is tiled with some bricks; climb up these bricks.

At the top of the brick wall, run straight forward, past another gossip stone.
Jump straight off the cliff, and go right into the moat.  Swim down to the end
of the moat until it breaks left, then climb up onto the small patch of dirt,
and from there climb up to the stone platform.  Run to the left from the stone
platform, where you will find Talon fast asleep.  If it turned from night to
day in the time it took you to sneak past the guards, then the Egg that Malon
gave you should have hatched into a Chicken.  If it hasn't hatched yet, you'll
have to stand around until it does.  Stand near Talon so that Navi flutters
near him, then use the Chicken to wake him up.

Speak with Talon, and he will suddenly remember that he left Malon behind.
He'll run off, clearing the path for you to push the milk crates near Talon
into position so that you can sneak in through the castle moat.  Push both of
the milk crates through the gap which was recently vacated by Talon.  You can
then climb onto the crates, and then jump over to the draining pipe which feeds
the moat.  If it's nighttime, then loiter around until it becomes daytime.  You
won't be able to sneak through the next area at night, as the guard is
increased at night.  Once it's daytime, climb through the drainage pipe to
enter the next area.

------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Courtyard (daytime)
New Item: Zelda's Letter
New Song: Zelda's Lullaby

Jump to the left, out of the small fountain.  Run to the left until the camera
changes to a small garden, with a patrolling guard in it.  Hiding behind the
tall hedge to stay hidden from the guard (if you are seen here, you'll be
thrown back to the milk crate area in the Hyrule Castle Garden).  Wait for the
guard to begin moving along the left side of the topiary in the center, then
quickly run across the bottom edge of the topiary, and left until the camera
shifts again.

Here, a pair of guards patrol a pair of fountains.  Again, hide behind the
hedge on the right side of the screen until the guards move into the proper
configuration for you to run by.  The time to run past, again along the bottom
edge, is when the left guard is walking between the pair of fountains, and the
right guard is walking along the upper edge of the right fountain.  Run to the
left until the camera shifts.

Try to ignore the rupees in the center of this topiary.  They're tempting, but
there actually isn't very many and the guard here guards them well.  Instead,
climb to the top of the topiary by going up the stairs, then slowly walk along
the wooden beam which extends over the topiary.  If you fall, it is possible to
make it back to hiding if you're extremely quick, but not likely.  On the other
side of the topiary, run to the left until the camera changes once more.

Hide behind the stone wall until the guards move into the proper configuration
to sneak by.  This time around, wait for the left guard to begin walking along
the left side of the statue, and for the right guard to begin moving along the
upper side of the statue.  Run to the left and take refuge behind another
hedge.

Wait for both of the guards to pass along the left side of the topiary, and
follow slowly behind the second guard as he moves along.  Stop when he stops,
move when he moves.  As long as you stay directly behind him, he won't spot
you.  Once you reach the northern edge of the topiary, run through the arch to
reach the center of the Courtyard, and the Princess of Destiny: Zelda.

Before you run up and talk to Zelda, there are two easter eggs in the courtyard
you may want to check out.  Shoot the window on the left side of the courtyard
with your Slingshot, and a guard will throw a bomb at you.  Look at the window
on the right, and you'll see images of Mario, Peach, Bowser and Yoshi.  Shoot
this window for a red rupee.  After you've done this, speak with Zelda.

Zelda will ask you if you have the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  Even though you
promised the Deku Tree you wouldn't tell anyone, it's okay to tell Zelda.
Confirm that you have it.  Zelda will then tell you about a dream she had, and
offers to tell you an ancient story passed down by the royal family - but only
if you don't tell anyone.  Promise not to tell, and she'll basically repeat the
ending to the Deku Tree's story.  She will then mention the Ocarina of Time and
the Temple of Time, then ask if you understand.  Say you do, whether you do or
not.  Zelda will then stand aside and let you see Ganondorf in person for the
first time (the dream sequence doesn't count!).  Agree to look through the
window, and Ganondorf will see you out of the corner of his eye.  Zelda will
then beg Link to help her save Hyrule from Ganondorf.  Agree to help her, and
she will give you Zelda's Letter.  This will let you pass through the gate in
Kakariko Village to Death Mountain.

Run towards the entrance to the courtyard, and you will find the way blocked by
Impa, Zelda's attendant (basically, nurse/bodyguard).  Impa will teach you
Zelda's Lullaby, easily the most important and overused song in the game.  Impa
will then show you back outside to Hyrule Field, and point you in the direction
of Kakariko Village.  But we're not ready to go there just yet.  Navi
recommends that we go and brag to Saria about how we're going to save the
world, which is actually a pretty good idea.  We'll be making a quick stop at
Lon Lon Ranch along the way as well.

Hyrule Field

Point yourself south, and head for the large structure whose opening is just
visible.  Run straight through to the opening to enter Lon Lon Ranch.  Make
sure it is daytime before you enter.

------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch (daytime)

Run forward a short ways, then immediately enter the first door on your left
that you reach.

--------------------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch - Ranch House (daytime)
New Item: Bottle #1

In this building, Talon will play a game with you.  He will throw three
"special" cuccos into the pack of regular cuccos, and if you can find all three
of the special cuccos before the time runs out, then he'll reward you with a
Bottle, filled with Lon Lon Milk.  You can do it "legit" by actually searching
for the cuccos yourself (they are indistinguishable from the others, only Talon
can tell the difference).  Or you can cheat by throwing all of the cuccos into
the corner, behind the long counter that Talon sits on.  "Select" the Cuccos by
picking them up.  Whichever way you choose, complete the minigame to receive
your first Bottle, then go back outside.

------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch (daytime)
New Song: Epona's Song

From the door, run to Link's left, through the arch to enter a large field.
Enter the pasture through the gate to the right, and talk to Malon in the
center.  Malon will thank you for waking up her father, then introduce you to
the pony Epona.  Epona will run away from you (she doesn't like strangers).
Speak with Malon again until she mentions her mother, then whip out your
Ocarina.  Malon will then teach you Epona's Song.  In addition to eventually
letting you ride Epona later in the game, Epona's Song will also get you free
Lon Lon Milk from ANY cow in the game.  This way you can avoid Talon's absurd
prices.

Leave the pasture, then go to the mill in the rear of the field (behind the
pasture).  Enter the door of the mill.

-------------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch - Mill (daytime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP02]

In the corner of the room, there are a large number of milk crates.  Push the
crates around so that they form this pattern:
   _ _
 X|_|_|
 _ _|_|
|_|_|_|

The X marks where a new tunnel will have appeared.  Crawl through the tunnel to
find an empty nest, which houses a Piece of Heart.  Take it, then crawl back
through the tunnel, leave the Mill and return to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Hang around Hyrule Field until it becomes nighttime, then reenter Lon Lon
Ranch.

--------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch (nighttime)
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS006] [GS007]

Run through the arch that leads to the pasture, and roll into the tree just to
the left of the arch.  Kill the Gold Skulltula that falls down, and take it's
token.  Now, circle around to the back of the pasture, so that you are on the
outer wall of the small awning.  Kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token,
but watch out for the Guay bird enemies.  Return to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Ignore the Stalchild enemies who appear here; we need to book it to Kokiri
Forest.  Head back to Kokiri Forest now, which is at the three o'clock position
on your map.  It's pretty much due east of Lon Lon Ranch.  Make sure it's
nighttime, then enter the hollowed out log, run across the Lost Woods Bridge
and enter Kokiri Forest.

--------------------------
Kokiri Forest (nighttime)
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS008]

Climb the hill to your right as you enter, and go around to the rear of the
Know-It-All Brother's House (the large, squat tree house with the giant leaf
coming out of it's top).  Kill the Gold Skulltula back here, and grab the token
by facing away from the token, holding down Z, and holding back and A to
backflip into the token.

Climb down to Mido's House, and climb up to the cliff behind his house.  Climb
up the Ivy Wall, go around the corner of the cliff, and through the hollowed
log to the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP03]
New Equipment: Bullet Bag x50

In order to find Saria, we'll have to follow the sound of her music through the
Lost Woods.  Or you could just follow my directions thoroughly.  Begin by going
to the right, through the hollowed log.

Run forward to the edge of the cliff, and whip out your Slingshot.  Shoot the
drum hanging from the tree limb, and try to adjust your aim so that you hit the
exact middle.  You'll know you've done it right, as it will give you 100 points
and make a small sound of victory when it works.  Try to get the center of the
Slingshot's "rubber band" aimed at approximately the center of the drum before
you fire.  Three successive shots to the exact center of the drum will cause a
Deku Scrub to appear, who will reward you with the Bullet Bag x50, the largest
Slingshot ammunition bag in the game.

Drop down the cliff to the small valley below, and go all the way to the right.
Stand on the low trunk, and two Skullkids will appear.  Take out your Ocarina,
and play a lengthy memory game with them.  Complete the entire game (three
rounds, each becoming increasingly longer and harder) to earn another Piece of
Heart.  The Skullkids play each addition to the song twice; to learn the new
part the fastest, watch the first Skullkid play the song, then play along with
the second one.  This way, you're in good shape when it's your turn to play the
tune.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, turn around and climb back up the ladder.  Go
through the hollowed log to the right of the ladder once you reach the top.  On
the other side, you will be ambushed by Kaepora Gaebora, with his most long-
winded bit of advice yet.  Tell him "No," you don't want to listen to the
feathery wind bag repeat his advice again.  If you're wondering, the stone arch
here goes to Goron City, one of our next destinations.  Unfortunately, as of
yet, we can't use this shortcut as we aren't properly equipped.  Go through the
hollowed log tunnel that KG was standing on.

On the other side, there is a pool.  This pool leads to Zora's Domain, but as
with the Goron City shortcut we're not properly equipped to use it yet.  Go
left through another tunnel.  Go straight from here through another tunnel,
then hang a left through another tunnel, then go right at the next crossroads
to enter the Sacred Forest Meadow.

-------------------------
The Sacred Forest Meadow
New Song: Saria's Song

Run forward a short ways, and you will immediately be ambushed by a Gray
Wolfos, the weakest variety of Wolfos.  Wolfos are a common enemy, especially
later in the game, but luckily are very easily defeated.  They like to defend
against most basic attacks, but are vulnerable immediately after they attack.
The easiest method to defeat the Gray Wolfos (or any Wolfos, for that matter)
is to stand still, and wait for them to move in close.  Just as they attack,
perform a back flip (Back + A while Z-Targeted) to dodge their attack, then
immediately after you land perform a Jump Attack (press A while Z-targeted).
The Wolfos will briefly have his back turned to you, and the Jump Attack will
kill it in one shot.

When the Gray Wolfos dies, the gate blocking the entrance to the Sacred Forest
Meadow will disappear, letting you in.  Turn to the right, then follow the path
around the corner.  Kill or run past the Deku Scrub (you must now attack the
Deku Scrubs to kill it, instead of just standing on it's nest), and go around
another corner.  Kill or dodge another Deku Scrub, and run around another
corner.  Take a left down a grassy detour, then another left back onto the main
road.

Jump into the pool of water at the end of the road, then jump back onto the
road with the Deku Scrub right in front of you.  Kill or dodge the Deku Scrub,
and go around the corner.  Take a left and go up the stairs.  Run down the long
corridor, killing/dodging two more Deku Scrubs, then run up the stairs.  At the
top, you will find Saria sitting in a small, overgrown courtyard.  Saria will
now teach you Saria's Song, which brings happiness to the depressed, and allows
you to communicate telepathically with Saria at any time.

Head back down the stairs you came up, down the long corridor, and down the
second flight of stairs.  Climb the ladder directly in front of you, and jump
along the cliffs to get out of Sacred Forest Meadow more quickly then how you
came in.  The pit in the middle of the upper cliffs area contains a Fairy
Fountain if you need Life.  Run back to the entrance to the Meadow and return
to the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods

Kaepora Gaebora will ambush you again with his dreaded Long Winded Speech of
Death attack.  Shoo him away, then take a right through the hollowed log to
return to Kokiri Forest.

--------------
Kokiri Forest

Turn right back around and re-enter the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP04]

Go left through the hollowed log, and jump onto the small trunk to interact
with the Skullkid (and yes, this is the same Skullkid who unwittingly becomes
the villain in Majora's Mask).  Play Saria's Song for the Scarecrow Kid, and
he'll give you a Piece of Heart (which should get you another complete Heart
Container).

If you still haven't picked up the Deku Stick x20 Upgrade, then head through
the tunnel in the rear of the area and get it now.  Otherwise, go back to the
Kokiri Forest, and return to Hyrule Field through the west exit.

-------------
Hyrule Field

We're now going to take Impa's advice and head for Kakariko Village, whose
entrance is in the very northeast corner of Hyrule Field (1:00 on the  clock
face).  Make your way directly there, and ignore any Stalchildren or Peahats
you may anger along the way.  Make sure that it's daytime before you enter.

---------------------------
Kakariko Village (daytime)
New Item: Bottle

Run forward through the arch in front of the town, and immediately grab the
Cucco (chicken) who is running around here.  The first order of business in
Kakariko is to gather up all the Cuccos around town and deliver them to the
Cucco Lady, who will give you a Bottle for your trouble.  Deliver the Cucco to
the Cucco Lady, and throw it into her pasture.  The Cucco Lady is found in the
south-eastern part of town, near the partially constructed building.

Grab the next Cucco very near the Cucco Lady's pasture, near the arch leading
to the Graveyard in the southeast corner.  The next Cucco is in a crate near
the center of town, across from the stairs leading to the upper level of
Kakariko.  The next Cucco is on the north side of town, on the upper level,
near the gate that leads to Death Mountain.  Grab the Cucco and return to the
lowest level of town, but don't throw it into the stable yet.

Note the Cucco who is trapped on a ledge near the large tree in the center of
town, which is blocked off by a tall fence.  The fence can't be climbed, and
the ledge is too high to jump up.  To reach this Cucco, climb up the stairs to
the partially constructed building, and jump off the edge towards the Cucco
while holding another Cucco in your hands.  The Cucco will help you float out
to the ledge.  Toss both Cuccos (the one you're holding and the one you just
reached) off the ledge, then deliver both Cuccos one at a time to the pasture.

Grab yourself another Cucco from the pasture, since more floating is needed to
reach the last two.  Climb up the long stairset to the east of the Cucco Lady's
pasture, and run straight to the edge, and aim yourself right at the elevated
platform which is fenced off.  If your aim is  precise, then you can make it
over the fence.  Toss the Cucco back over the fence so that it lands near the
well (but not in it), then run down the stairs.

Being careful not to fall into the pit (doing so will reset the Cuccos in
Kakariko Village, forcing you to start over from the beginning), grab another
Cucco running around in the small grotto behind the building.  Climb back up
the stairs, and throw this Cucco over the fence so that it lands near the well
(but not in it) also.

Drop back down into the grotto, then climb the tall ladder near where you found
your most recent Cucco.  Climb it all the way to the top, and work your way
around behind the Windmill.  Grab the last Cucco (sometimes it wanders over to
the very top of the ladder you just climbed up), then jump off the cliff,
heading towards the Cucco Lady's pasture.  Throw your Cucco into the pasture,
then grab the other two who should still be wandering around by the Well.
Return them to the Pasture as well, then speak to Cucco Lady, who will give you
a Bottle for your trouble.

But the Cucco Jumping Fun isn't over yet!  Grab another Cucco from the pasture,
since we're now going to be gliding out to the rickety balcony which sits above
the Cucco pasture.  Climb the stairs to the unfinished building, then go around
to the front side of the stack of bricks.  Throw the Cucco up to the first
level of the stack of bricks, then quickly climb up and grab the Cucco again
before it has a chance to run off the edge.  Repeat the process again on the
second level of the brick pile.

Turn to the right, to the narrow beam which has the carpenter running back and
forth along it aimlessly.  Wait for the carpenter to reach the left side of the
beam, then start going right again before you jump out onto the beam yourself.
Run along the beam, and when you reach the corner where the beam bends to the
right, leap off the edge and steer yourself right for the balcony.  You'll just
barely make it onto the ledge (in fact, you'll likely clip onto the ledge).
Throw aside the Cucco and enter the crack in the building.

------------------------------------------
Kakariko Village - Impa's House (daytime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP05]

Take the Piece of Heart, then leave the way you came in.

---------------------------
Kakariko Village (daytime)

Jump off the balcony and land back by the Cucco Lady.  Head through the stone
archway in the southeast corner of Kakariko Village to reach the Kakariko
Graveyard.

-----------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard (daytime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS009]

Run to the right and slash the bushes to pieces, and take their contents.  Pick
up the rock as well, and capture one of the bugs that appear in a Bottle.  Pass
under the arch then follow the stone path to the left side of the graveyard,
where there is a patch of soft earth.  Stand near the patch of soft earth, and
release the bug you captured (which has magically become three separate bugs).
Quickly recapture one of the bugs in the bottle, while the other two will
wander around briefly, then burrow into the soft earth.  A few seconds later, a
Gold Skulltula will appear.  Kill it and take it's token, then head for the
back of the graveyard where the largest tombstone is.

Stand on the large Triforce symbol burned into the grass in front of the
tombstone, take out your Ocarina and play Zelda's Lullaby.  The tombstone will
literally explode, revealing a pit.  Drop down the pit.

-----------------------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard - Royal Family's Tomb
New Song: Sun's Song

Run down the ramp and run in circles around the large bone pit to attract the
attention of all the Keese in the room.  Pick them off with your Slingshot or
with sword attacks.  Once they are all dead, the door at the top of the
stairset will unlock.  Climb the stairs and go through the door.

Hug the left wall of this room and run to it's end.  Ignore the attention of
any Redeads you may attract on the way - for Young Link, it's easiest to avoid
Redeads then to kill them.  Enter the doorway on the opposite end of the room,
and pass through the shadowy tunnel to find a large tomb.

Read the inscription on the tomb to discover the notes to the Sun's Song, which
turns Night into Day and Day into Night.  No more standing around Hyrule Field
waiting for time to pass!  Return to the entrance to the tomb and enter the
beam of light to warp back to the Graveyard.

Now that you have the Sun's Song, you also have access to a quick and easy 80
rupees.  If you return to the entrance to Hyrule Castle in Hyrule Field, then
climb up the chains on the gate, then you can play the Sun's Song.  The gate
will retract, letting you walk along the edge of the gate to claim four
invisible red rupees.  This is known as the "Sun's Song Rupee Trick," and I
will reference it a few times throughout the guide.

-------------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)

It's now nighttime, so you can interact with the gravestones around the
Graveyard without Dampe's Fanboy yelling at you for it.  Head for the front row
of gravestones, and stand behind the grave with the flowers behind it.  Grab a
hold of it, and pull back to reveal a pit beneath the gravestone.  Be careful
pulling aside any other gravestones - they all contain Poe enemies, who become
invisible when Z-Targeted.  Drop down the pit.

----------------------------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard - Shield Grave (nighttime)
New Equipment: Hylian Shield

Run forward and open the chest to find the Hylian Shield.  This shield is WAY
too big for Young Link to handle, but does let him curl up like a turtle and
become pretty much immune to all damage.  Which is cool.  Stay on the Deku
Shield for now, but once we get to Death Mountain we'll want to switch the
Hylian Shield, whose metal is impervious to flame attacks.

Enter the beam of light and return to the Graveyard.

-------------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)

Go to the rear row of gravestones, and go to the far right.  Counting from the
right to the left, pull aside the fourth gravestone to reveal another pit.
Drop down the pit.

------------------------------------------
Kakariko Grave - Redead Grave (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP06]

The Redead in this grave guards a Piece of Heart.  Just go ape crazy on this
Redead, attacking him repeatedly.  The faster you attack him, the less
opportunity he gets to attack you back.  If he does manage to grab hold of you,
tap buttons and rotate the joystick like mad to free yourself.  Once the Redead
is permanently defeated (it will make an extra loud SWIPE noise when it is),
play the Sun's Song to make a chest appear that contains a Piece of Heart.
Open the chest, take the Piece of Heart, and return to Kakariko Graveyard.

-------------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP07]

It's now time to play Dampe's Heart-Pounding Gravedigging Tour to find another
Piece of Heart.  Dampe takes a circular route around the graveyard, following
the path.  If you stand directly in his path, then he will stop.  In one of the
twelve dirt patches dotted around the graveyard, there is hidden a Piece of
Heart.  In order to find the Piece of Heart, stand directly on that dirt patch
so that way Dampe will stop directly in front of it, then speak to Dampe and
pay him 10 rupees to dig up that patch of dirt.  Most of the dirt patches
contain at the very least some rupees.  Keep playing the game until you dig up
the Piece of Heart.  The Piece of Heart randomly changes places every time you
leave the zone, so if you have to leave to restock on Rupees, then just start
over from the beginning.

If you go broke, then return to Hyrule Castle and use the Gatehouse and the
Drawbridge Trick to earn more rupees for the game.  Dampe's Gravedigging Game
only runs for the first part of the night, so if Dampe isn't there then you'll
have to go hang around Hyrule Field until it becomes nighttime again, then
return to the Graveyard.  The Sun's Song won't work (it makes the time either
noon or midnight, and the Gravedigging Tour is open during neither time).  Once
you have the Piece of Heart, return to Kakariko Village.

-----------------------------
Kakariko Village (nighttime)
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x5 [GS010] [GS011] [GS012] [GS013]
                                         [GS014]
There are a ton of Golden Skulltulas to find and kill here in the dead of
night.  The first is at the Unfinished House, on the pile of bricks.  Kill it
with the Slingshot before trying to jump up and grab the token (the sword will
cause you to take damage because of the extreme close range).  The second
Skulltula can be found on the building directly to the west of the Unfinished
Building (the House of Skulltula).  It sits directly beneath a window on the
left side of the building.

The third Skulltula can be found by rolling into the tree near the center of
Kakariko Village.  The fourth can be found on top of the tall observation tower
on the upper level of Kakariko Village.  Shoot it with the slingshot before
climbing up the ladder to claim it.  The last of the Skulltulas can be found in
the northern edge of the village, on the north side of the building closest to
the Death Mountain Gate.

Head back to the lower level of Kakariko Village, and enter the House of
Skulltula (the single-story building next to the unfinished building).

-----------------------------
Kakariko Village (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Adult's Wallet

Enter the building, and turn to the right.  Speak to the man, and he will
reward you with the Adult's Wallet, the award for killing 10 Golden Skulltulas
and claiming their tokens.  Return to Kakariko Village.

-----------------------------
Kakariko Village (nighttime)

Go to the northern edge of the village and speak with the guard by the gate.
He will refuse to let you through to Death Mountain Trail.  Show him Zelda's
Letter, and he'll let you through, though he'll think it's all a big joke.  He
will request, however, that you return to the Hyrule Castle Market and pick up
a Keaton mask for him.  This is the first step of the Happy Mask Trading
Sequence, the Young Link trading game.  It's entirely optional, and doesn't
directly reward you with anything of any particular use (indirectly, you do get
a Deku Stick and Deku Nut upgrade apiece), but if you're a completionist you
still might want to do it.

If you choose to do the Happy Mask trading sequence, then keep following this
guide from this point.  Otherwise, skip down to the Death Mountain Trail
heading.

Head back to Hyrule Field, and enter Hyrule Castle and into the Market.

---------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

The Happy Mask Shop is now open for business.  It's the small building near the
Temple of Time, to the right of the entrance to the Hyrule Castle Garden.
Enter the building.

------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop (daytime)
New Item: Keaton Mask

Speak with the Happy Mask Salesman at the counter, who will explain the process
of the Happy Mask trading game.  You will now be able to select masks from the
shop windows as though you were buying them from a regular shop.  Select the
only one available, the Keaton Mask, and return to Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Return to the guard by the gate to Death Mountain, and speak to him while
wearing the Keaton Mask.  He'll pay you 15 rupees for the mask.  Now, you've
got to go back to Hyrule Market to the Happy Mask Shop, so you can pay the 10
rupee fee for the mask.  Isn't this Happy Mask sequence FUN!?

------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop (daytime)
New Item: Skull Mask

Pay the 10-rupee fee for the Keaton Mask, and then borrow the Skull Mask.
We'll sell this one in a little while; for now, let's continue with our journey
and start up Death Mountain.  Leave the shop and return to Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Head to the northern gate, and go through to Death Mountain Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail

Before you progress any further, now is the time to replace your Deku Shield
with the Hylian Shield you should have picked up in Kakariko  Graveyard.  Do
this on the Equipment Submenu.

Go forward a bit, and kill the Tektite.  If he tries to jump on you, do the
Turtle Defense with the Hylian Shield (hold R).  Go around the corner and
defeat two more Tektites.  You can vaguely hear a Gold Skulltula here, but you
won't be able to reach it until you get access to Bombs.  Keep following the
path up and around, and defeat another Tektite who jumps down from on high.
Note the Piece of Heart high above the giant boulder - we'll get to it in a few
minutes.

Go up and around the corner, and keep going up the path.  Watch out for the
rolling Goron who crashes through here periodically.  Keep following the path
until you reach a large wooden post with a red flag tied to it.  From here, you
can go left to keep climbing the mountain, or go right to Goron City.  Go
right.  Keep following the path, past the large stone pedestal with the ring of
rocks, and enter the archway carved into the stone to enter Goron City.

-----------
Goron City
New Equipment: Goron's Bracelet

There's a ton of hidden stuff in Goron City, but unfortunately you need Bombs
to access them.  So for right now, we'll just have to stick to the task at
hand.  Jump down to Goron City's lowest level.  Look for the sealed door with
the carpeting in front of it.  Stand on the carpet, and play Zelda's Lullaby to
make the door open.  Enter the room on the other side of the door to find
Darunia, who will be very unhappy that you aren't the royal messenger, as he
had believed.  Play Saria's Song while standing directly in front of him to
cheer him up.

Now cheered up considerably, Darunia will listen to your story.  He'll mention
that Ganondorf has already been by to find the Stone.  After Darunia refused,
Ganondorf sealed up the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern, blocking off the Goron's
primary food source.  Now, his people are starving.  But what's worse,
Ganondorf also awoke monsters inside Dodongo's Cavern.  So even if they managed
to open the cave, they'd be eaten alive just trying to be fed.

Darunia promises to give you the Spiritual Stone of Fire, but only if you can
defeat the monsters in the cave.  He'll give you the Goron's Bracelet to help,
which can be used to pick up and use Bomb Flowers that grow around Death
Mountain.

Before you leave Darunia's Room, whip out a Deku Stick and light it on the
torch in his cave.  Quickly run back outside, and use the flaming Deku Stick to
light the empty sconce outside.  Swing your sword to put away the Deku Stick,
then pull out another Deku Stick and light it again.  Use the flame to light
all of the braziers on the bottom level of Goron City.  Once all the braziers
are lit, then the giant pot in the middle of the room will begin spinning.
This is absolutely useless for now, but after we finish the next dungeon we'll
be coming back to finish the puzzle.  You can also use the lit Deku Stick to
ignite the Bomb Flowers near the sealed up room, which will blow open the wall
and let you access the Goron City Shop (not that it has anything of real value
to buy... yet).

Head up the stairs between the pair of yellow-striped posts to reach the second
level of Goron City.  Run to the right, where you will find two unlit torched
and a Goron sitting in front of a tunnel.  Run down this tunnel to see a long
line of boulders surrounded by Bomb Flowers.  Pick up one of the Bomb Flowers,
and drop it near the boulders to clear a path.  Go through to the end of the
tunnel.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS015]

Welcome back to the Lost Woods!  It's time to unload that Skull Mask for the
Happy Mask Trading Game, and get the second Deku Stick upgrade as well.  If you
want to skip this section, then go down to the heading that reads "Goron City."

Go left through the tunnel, then left again, then left one final time.  You'll
be in a small clearing which is a dead end.  Defeat both of the Business Scrubs
here, then look for the patch of soft earth near the right Business Scrub.
Release your Bottled Bugs near the patch of soft earth, and recapture one of
the bugs before they all disappear.  Kill the Gold Skulltula who emerges from
the patch, and take its token.

Now, run to the large tree in the back of the clearing, and look for a cluster
of butterflies in the tall grass.  These butterflies are actually gathered
around an invisible pit.  Drop down into the pit to reach the Forest Stage.

-------------
Forest Stage
New Upgrade: Deku Sticks x30

Put on the Skull Mask and take a few steps forward.  The Deku Scrubs in the
stage will begin to cheer and mob you.  Run over to the right side of the room
(facing from the entrance), and the Deku Scrub Chief will increase the number
of Deku Sticks you can carry by 10.  Once you have the upgrade, enter the beam
of light to return to the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS016]

Leave the clearing through the log tunnel, then go right, right again, and then
left.  Hang a right, then forward, and forward again.  You'll find yourself
back by the Lone Skullkid.  If you haven't played Saria's Song for him yet,
then do so now for the Piece of Heart he has.  Otherwise, speak to him while
wearing the Skull Mask, and he'll buy it from you.  Unfortunately, he'll buy it
from you for less then it's worth, so you're going to have to pay the
difference next time you're in town.

Once you have sold the Skull Mask, enter the mouth of the log tunnel behind
you.  At the edge of the cliff on the other side is another patch of soft
earth.  Drop a Bottled Bug into the patch (remember to recapture one of the
three bugs that pops out), and kill the Gold Skulltula who emerges from the
earth.  Take it's token.  If you still haven't purchased the first Deku Stick
Upgrade, then do so now.  It's at the other end of the valley.

Make your way back through the Lost Woods to the stone archway and return to
Goron City.

-----------
Goron City

Back on the second level of Goron City, go to the far left of the ledge and go
up the stairs between the pair of red-striped posts.  When the stairs split
left and right, go right.  At the top of the stairs, you'll find yourself on
Goron City's top floor.  Go right from the stairwell exit, then right again the
first chance you get to return to Death Mountain Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP08]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS017]

Go around the corner to the right, where there is a small alcove with a Bomb
Flower in it.  Pick up the Bomb Flower, and throw it off the cliff so that it
lands on or near the boulder blocking Dodongo's Cavern.  It may take a few
tries to get it right.  After the boulder is out of the way, then face away
from the edge, and hold down Z (if you Z-target anything, then you won't be
able to do this next part right, so make sure you're not targeting anything).
Run backwards towards the edge of the cliff, and when you reach the fence, hold
back and press A to backflip over the fence.  If you do it just right, then
you'll land on the cliff above Dodongo's Cavern and be able to get the Piece of
Heart.  This should complete another Heart Container, as well.

Drop down from the cliff, and enter the mouth of Dodongo's Cavern.  Stop to
drop a bug in the patch of soft earth (remember to recapture one of the three
who comes out), and kill the Gold Skulltula who emerges.  Take the Token, then
enter Dodongo's Cavern.

The game's second dungeon, Dodongo's Cavern, doesn't make a huge leap forward
in terms of concept, though there are many more puzzles to be solved and the
dungeon takes much longer.  The main goal of the dungeon is to open the large
Dodongo's Skull in the rear of the Cavern's main chamber, where the boss
resides.  To do this, the player must first find a way to the catwalk above the
Skull.  Simple to describe, easy to do, but it's still a dungeon.  Don't get
sloppy.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

If you still haven't equipped your Hylian Shield, then do so now.  The Deku
Shield can get destroyed very quickly in this place.

Grab one of the Bomb Flowers to your right, and throw it near the cracked wall.
The explosion will destroy the wall, revealing Dodongo's Cavern.  Run forward
into the large antechamber, and along the wooden flooring.  Jump out to the
large island in the middle of the embers.  Dodge the  Beamos, and head to the
right side of the room.

Grab the bomb flower in front of the large window, and quickly Z-target the
Beamos enemy to the right of the Bomb Flower.  Run at the Beamos, and throw the
Bomb Flower at it.  If you do it right, then the Bomb Flower should strike the
Beamos on the head and cause the whole apparatus to explode.  Grab another Bomb
Flower and use it to blow open the sealed wall to the right of the Beamos.  Go
through the darkened tunnel to the next room.

----------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Lower Southeast Hall

Run forward a bit, and quickly kill the Baby Dodongos who come out of the
ground.  Be careful, though, as hitting them will cause them to explode.  Move
out of the way as quick as you can to avoid damage.  Once the Dodongos are dead
or have run away, keep following the hall.  You will come to a place where
another Baby Dodongo appears, as well as a sealed up wall.  Stand next to the
sealed up wall, and then kill the Baby Dodongo as it moves by it.  The
explosion will destroy the barrier, letting you access the door on the other
side.  If you screw up, you'll have to leave the dungeon and re-enter to reset
the Baby Dodongos.

------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Torch Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS018]

Kill the trio of Keese on the opposite wall.  Watch out though; if they fly
through the flame of the torch, they will catch on fire and deal additional
damage (and also destroy your Deku Shield if you are still using it).  Use the
Hylian Shield to absorb their attacks and douse the flame.  Kill the Gold
Skulltula on the wall, take the token (you may need to use a backflip to reach
it), and return to the Lower Southeast Hall.

----------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Lower Southeast Hall

Turn to the right and kill the respawned Baby Dodongos.  Climb up the ledge and
run to the other end of the room.  Grab hold of one of the Armos Statues, and
push it into place onto the gray switch.  This will unlock the door.  Jump up
onto the ledge and enter the door.

-------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Southeast Passage

Z-target the Keese on either side of the room and kill them with the Slingshot.
Break open the pots, take their contents, and head through the door on the
other end of the passage.

-----------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Lizalfos Nest (lower)

This room contains a new kind of enemy - the Lizalfos.  These enemies usually
travel in pairs, and take turns fighting their target (in this case, you).
Don't bother chasing after them - they just run away.  Wait for them to come to
you.  Luckily, all of their attacks are easily blocked using the Turtle Shield
technique.  After they've attacked, quickly swing out with your sword.  Keep on
playing the waiting game until both of the Lizalfos are defeated.

After the Lizalfos are dead, the door on the west side of the room will unlock.
Go through it.

-------------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Dodongo Breeding Ground

Run to the end of the passage, noting the sealed wall to the right.  Behind it
is a door to a room which contains a lousy Business Scrub who sells Deku Sticks
for fifteen rupees a pop.  You shouldn't be short on Deku Sticks at all, so
ignore the wall unless you need one.

Run to the end of the passage, and kill the pair of Dodongos in the long room
by running around behind them and attacking their tail.  Watch out - they blow
up just like the Baby Dodongos.  Return to the entrance to the long room and
light a Deku Stick on the torch.  Use the flaming Deku Stick to light the three
empty sconces along the room (each is very near to where one of the three
Dodongos was).  Once all three are lit, the door at the west end of the hall
will open.  Go through it.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

You are now inside the "window" you passed earlier in the Antechamber, the
large room with the giant Dodongo's head.  Run forward and step onto the
switch, which will open the door on the far side of the room.  Drop down out of
the window.  If you miss the switch, you'll have to go all the way back around
and hit it again.

Run across the platforms and cliffs to the west side of the room.  Before you
go through the door you just unlocked, grab the Bomb Flower near the door and
use it to blast open the sealed wall to the left of the Bomb Flower.  Open the
chest on the other side to find the Dungeon Map.  Go through the door you
unlocked, in the northwest corner of the room.

------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Bomb Flower Room

Run down the hall and into the room.  Note the large number of Bomb Flowers
clustered around the iron pillar.  Go to the south end of the room, and use the
Bomb Flower against the oddly-colored wall to break open the sealed wall.  Go
through the opened wall and through the door.

-----------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Armos Trap Room
New Dungeon Item: Compass

This room contains three Armos Statues surrounding a chest.  In order to reach
the chest, you're going to have to destroy the Armos Knight in front of the
chest.  This Armos Knight isn't like the ones you've seen previously - this one
will come to life if you touch it.  To defeat it, grab a Bomb Flower, and drop
it near the Armos Knight (don't throw it - drop it).  Just before the Bomb
Flower explodes, strike the Armos Knight with your sword to bring it to life.
The explosion will kill the Knight, and he will begin spinning rapidly and
flashing.  After a few seconds, it will explode.  Try to stay out of the
Knight's range until after this time.  Open the chest to find the Compass, then
return to the previous room.

------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Bomb Flower Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS019]

Grab the Bomb Flower to your right as you come out of the door, and throw it
directly between the two long lines of Bomb Flowers surrounding the Iron
Pillar.  The Bomb Flowers will all ignite simultaneously, moving the pillar to
a lower level.  If the Bomb Flower isn't thrown in the exact center of the
lines, then it won't ignite properly.

Once the pillar has dropped, climb up the stairs it created to the top.  There
is a Gold Skulltula in an alcove here, but we won't be able to reach it until
we come back later with the Boomerang.  Go left or right at the top of the iron
pillar, and follow the path as it winds around to the top of the room.  Destroy
the Skulltula and the Gold Skulltula hanging from the ivy, then climb up the
ivy to grab the token.  Drop back down and go through the door in front of the
ivy.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Pillar Room

This room has a pair of Fire Keese flying around it.  Circle around the room,
taking them out with the Slingshot.  Use the Turtle Shield guard if a Keese
starts to fly at you.  Go around to the south side of the pillar, and note the
ladder behind the Armos Statue.  Pull the Armos Statue away from the ladder,
and be careful not to touch any of the other statues - they are actually Armos
Knights in disguise.

Climb up the ladder to the top of the pillar, and step on the switch to unlock
the door in the east of the room.  Go east to the next room.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

You're now very high up in the Antechamber, on the rear catwalks in the upper
level.  Run forward and along the catwalk.  Run past or kill the Fire Keese,
and leap over the gap in the catwalk.  Run through the tunnel to the room on
the other side.

-----------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Blade Trap Room

This room is full of pillars, and has a number of blade traps which spring
towards you if you enter their line of sight.  Run between the line of pillars
to the rear of the room, where there is a stone block set in the wall beneath a
ladder.  Climb onto the stone block, then up the ladder.  Stand on the narrow
ledge at the top of the cliff, and carefully turn around so that you can see
the small platform.  Jump out to it; you'll just barely make it.

Open the chest for a red rupee.  Grab the Bomb Flower, and hold onto it until
it is almost ready to explode.  Then, throw it at the wall above the ladder to
blast open the seal.  Once the seal is destroyed, jump out to the opened tunnel
and run through the tunnel to the next room.

-------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - The Solo Eye Room

Shoot the golden eye above the circle of flames with your Slingshot, and the
ring of fire will disappear.  Jump across the now flame-free platform to the
other side, and through the tunnel.  Watch out for the Baby Dodongo's who will
unearth themselves along the way.  Go through the door at the end of the hall.

-----------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Lizalfos Nest (upper)

This is the upper level of the Lizalfos Nest room (the lower level is off the
cliff on the other side of the room).  Kill the Lizalfos exactly how you did
before; wait for the Lizalfos to come to you, block their attacks with the
Turtle Shield technique, and attack with Jump Attacks.  Once both of the
Lizalfos are dead, the door to the west will open.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - The Double Eye Room

This room is similar to the Solo Eye Room, but there are now two eyes you have
to shoot.  Begin by shooting the eye on the high wall, above the flames.  The
first ring of flames will disappear.  Jump out to the platform, and look to the
left to see another golden eye in an alcove.  Shoot this with your Slingshot as
well, and the second ring of flames will disappear, leaving you free to jump
the rest of the way across.  Run through the darkened tunnel to the next room.

-----------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Blade Trap Room
New Item: Bomb
New Equipment: Bomb Bag x20

You're now in the upper area of the Blade Trap Room.  Jump across the gap, and
turn to the right to see a chest on an upper ledge.  Jump up to the ledge and
open the chest to find the Bomb Bag, which contains 20 Bombs.  Turn around, and
go through the tunnel to the right.

--------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber
You're back in the Antechamber, this time in the upper level near the front of
the room.  Step onto the switch directly in front of you, and one of the
floating pillars below will rise to the top, giving you access to the upper
level of the dungeon should you fall.

Run to the right, and head across the catwalk.  Jump over the first gap in the
catwalk, so that you are standing in between the two gaps.  Using your new
bombs, drop bombs through the gaps in the catwalk so that they land in the
giant Dodongo's skulls eye sockets (press the C-Button assigned to Bombs twice
to drop bombs).  Igniting blasts in both eye sockets will cause the skull to
open it's mouth, letting you access the last area of the dungeon.

Before you drop down and enter the Dodongo's mouth, run to the end of the
catwalk and blow open the sealed wall.  Open the chest for a replacement Deku
Shield, or a blue rupee if you still have your old one.  Drop down to the
central platform in the Antechamber and enter the Dodongo's mouth.  Enter the
door inside.

-----------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Back Room

Drop down into the large pit area.  Kill the Fire Keese flapping around the
room, then climb up the ledge to the east.  Run through the darkened tunnel to
the next room.

-----------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Goron Graveyard

Run down the tunnel and follow it's curve to the left.  Jump down into the pit
on the other side of the tunnel, and watch out for the two Fire Keese who will
come swooping in.  Go to the left, around the barrier, and then to the right on
it's other side.  Run to the far wall, and jump up and over the small ledge.
Go down into the pit on the other side.  There is a sealed wall here.  Climb up
next to it and drop a bomb next to the wall to break it open.  Go through the
door on the other side.

-------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Armos Knight Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS020]

This room contains a single Gold Skulltula, behind an Armos Knight statue.
Normally, you'd have to kill the Armos Knight to reach the Gold Skulltula, but
not so this time.  Kill the Gold Skulltula with your Slingshot, then carefully
move forward to grab the token without touching the Knight.

Return to the previous room.  If you do accidentally brush against the Armos
Knight, use your Bombs to defeat him.

-----------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Goron Graveyard

Drop down from the doorway, and climb up the ledge to the left.  Watch out for
the Fire Keese, who have respawned.  On the ledge, climb up onto the brown
block, then climb again onto the next ledge.  Run to the end of the ledge, and
jump down into the pit.  Break the pots to find recovery items and a Fairy (put
it in a bottle if you have a spare).  Enter the darkened tunnel after you have
pilfered the items.

----------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Backroom

Run to the end of the tunnel until you reach a brown stone block set into a
track in the floor.  Push the block off the edge to the floor below.  Kill the
Fire Keese in the room, then pull the stone block away from the wall.  Once
it's far enough away that you can move around to it's other side, push the
block into the opening in the floor in center of the room, and the western door
will unlock.  Go through it.

---------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - The Pit

Open the chest on the other end of the room to get some Bombs, then drop a Bomb
onto the iron plate in the middle of the room.  After the bomb explodes, the
plate will disintegrate, letting you drop down the pit into the room below.
Drop down.

-----------B-O-S-S-------------
Infernal Dinosaur KING DODONGO
New Upgrade: Heart Container x1
New Quest Item: Goron's Ruby

King Dodongo is a very easy boss (arguably easier then Gohma, but it's a
difficult argument).  He has two main phases; one, where he lumbers around the
room in a circle, and will breathe fire at you.  Two, where he rolls up into a
ball and ricochets around the room.  In order to damage him, you must wait for
him to begin inhaling in the first phase, and quickly throw a Bomb into his
mouth.  The bomb will explode in his stomach, stunning the King Dodongo for a
few seconds.  You are given only one sword swing when he is stunned, so make it
a Jump Attack.

After you have hurt Dodongo, he will begin his second phase.  Stand on the edge
of the lava or in one of the corners of the room to avoid his rolling attack.
After the King Dodongo rolls halfway around the room, he will revert to Phase
One, where the fight's pattern resets.  After three Jump Attacks or six normal
sword attacks, King Dodongo will die.

Grab the Heart Container he leaves behind, and enter the ring of light to warp
back outside, where Darunia will give you the Goron's Ruby, and make you an
official Blood Brother.  From this point on, Darunia and all of the Gorons
become huge Link fanboys.  Darunia even ends up naming his son after you.
Darunia also recommends that you visit the Great Fairy who lives on top of
Death Mountain (which we will in a little while).

Death Mountain Trail
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS021]

Go to the right and drop off the cliff.  Kill the Tektites, then look for the
oddly-shaped and oddly-colored bit of wall.  Use a Bomb to blast open the wall,
then use the Slingshot to kill the Gold Skulltula on the inside.  The wall is
climbable; climb up it to grab the Token.

Head back towards Dodongo's Cavern, and begin climbing up the Trail back
towards Goron City.  Kill any Tektites you may come across along the way.  Turn
right at the Red Flag, and keep heading for Goron City.  You'll find another
odd part of wall identical to the one that hid the Gold Skulltula.  Blow it
open if you like, but don't open the chest inside unless you need rupees - it
contains a 50 rupee piece.  Head down into Goron City.

-----------
Goron City
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP09]
New Equipment: Bomb Bag x30
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS022]

Go to the left from the entrance until you reach a barrier of boulders.  Use a
bomb to blow open a path, and go through the tunnel behind and to the left of
the boulders.

You'll come to a room overflowing with boulders.  The brown ones can be blown
up with bombs; the silver ones cannot.  Destroy the brown rock to your right as
you enter the "rock maze," then the brown rock behind it.  Go through the gap
you have created, and destroy the brown rock on the left.  Go through the new
gap, and take a right.  Destroy the brown stone directly in front of you, and
you will reach the end of the "maze."

The chests contains two more fifty rupee pieces - save them for later if your
Adult's Wallet is maxed.  Roll into the crate here to destroy it, and kill the
Gold Skulltula that appears.  Take it's token, and return to the main part of
Goron City.  You now have 20 Skulltula Tokens, enough for the second reward
from the House of Skulltula in Kakariko Village.  We'll get to it in a few
minutes.

Drop down to the third level of the city (the level directly beneath the top
floor), where there is a Biggoron rolling around the level in a giant loop.
You can stop him by placing a bomb in his path so that it explodes just as he
passes over it.  If you do this while he is passing through the tunnel in the
northern part of the third floor, then he will give you the Bomb Bag x30 as a
reward for your daring.

Once you have the Big Bomb Bag, drop down to the second level of Goron City
(the level directly below the floor with the Rolling Biggoron).  If you still
haven't lit all of the torches on the bottom floor using the flame from
Darunia's room, then do it now.  This will cause the giant pot to begin
rotating around the room.  From the second level, you can throw bombs into the
giant pot.  If you successfully land a bomb inside the pot, then it will begin
to spin rapidly, finally coming to a stop.  If it stops on the side with the
happy face, then you will get a Piece of Heart.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, climb back up to the second level of Goron
City and use the secret passage to go to the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods
New Upgrade: Deku Nut Upgrade x30

Go left as you come out of the Goron City tunnel, and left again at the pool in
the next area.  Go straight at the next crossroads, and then left.  Use a Bomb
to blow up the boulder in the corner of this crossroads.  Drop down the pit,
and defeat both of the Business Scrubs inside with your Slingshot.  One of them
will increase the number of Deku Nuts you can carry for forty rupees.  Accept
the deal, then return to Goron City.

-----------
Goron City

Climb to the top level of Goron City and return to Death Mountain Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail

Return to the Red Flag, on the right side of the road leading down from Goron
City.  Begin climbing the steeper part of the trail, on the left side of the
flag post as you face Goron City.  After a short climb up a steep slope, you
come to a series of ledges with numerous boulders on it.  Use bombs to destroy
each of these boulders, and climb up the series of ledges.  You will have to
throw a bomb at one of the boulders to destroy it, so remember to hold it until
just before it is ready to explode.  The last boulder at the top of the ledges
hides a pit, which contains, among other things, a Cow which you can use to
replenish your supply of Milk (play Epona's Song).

Keep heading north, further up the Trail.  After a short distance, the volcano
will begin erupting, spewing lava down onto you.  When you see the shadow
beneath you, hide under the Hylian Shield with R to absorb the damage.  Once
you reach the cliff face, the eruptions will stop.

Once you are at the cliff face, use your Slingshot to kill the Skulltula, then
climb up the wall to the first ledge.  Shoot down another Skulltulla with your
Slingshot, then climb up to the second ledge.  On the second ledge, shoot down
another Skulltula, then climb up to the highest peak of the mountain.

Kaepora Gaebora waits for you here.  DO NOT SPEAK TO HIM.  If you do, he'll
give you a ride back down the mountain to Kakariko Village, which you don't
want to do just yet.  Bomb the oddly-colored wall to the left of KG, and enter
the cave.

----------------------------------------------
Death Mountain Trail - Great Fairy's Fountain
New Upgrade: Magic Meter x1, Super Spin Attack

Run forward to the fountain, and stand on the Triforce emblem.  Play Zelda's
Lullaby to make the Dominatrix er, uh... Great Fairy appear.  She will teach
you the Super Spin Attack, which adds extra damage and range to your basic Spin
Attack.  She'll also grant you a Magic Meter.  Leave the Fountain to return to
Death Mountain Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail

Don't speak with Kaepora Gaebora just yet.  We've got one more Gold Skulltula
token to grab while we're up here.  Enter the cave face to the right of KG.

----------------------
Death Mountain Crater
New Quest Item: Gold Skultulla Token x1 [GS023]

Young Link can't handle the intense flames of Death Mountain Crater.  You'll
have to return when Link is older, wiser, and has some sexy new clothes before
you can do much here.  For the moment, smash both of the crates to your left as
soon as you enter to find a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token, then
go back out to the Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail

Speak with Kaepora Gaebora, who will give you a lift down the mountain to
Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

You're done on Death Mountain for a little while, so if you like you can switch
back to your Deku Shield now.

Kaepora Gaebora not only brought you back to Kakariko Village... he even
dropped you on top of Impa's House!  What a guy!  If you didn't get the Piece
of Heart from inside of Impa's House, then get it now by dropping down from the
roof onto the balcony above the Cucco Pasture.  If you miss it, then play the
Sun's Song and you'll warp back to the top of the roof.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, or if you already had it from your first
visit to Kakariko, then drop down off the roof, and enter the House of
Skulltula, the single-story building directly across from Impa's House.

-------------------
House of Skulltula
New Quest Item: Stone of Agony

Go to the left side of the room, where a recently-decursed man will give you
the Stone of Agony.  The Stone works in conjunction with the Rumble Pak, and
shakes when you go near hidden entrances that need to be bombed open.  Sure,
this is only useful for finding only a handful of Gold  Skulltulas, but hey...
it's still kind of cool.  Head back outside.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Leave through the west end of the village to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Before we continue on with our journey, we have a few errands to run in Hyrule
Castle.  Head west from Kakariko Village to Hyrule Castle.  If it is nighttime,
play the Sun's Song to open the gates.  Enter Hyrule Castle, and go through the
Market to the Garden.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Garden

Climb the ivy on the right to the cliff above the gate.  Run over to the marble
gate, and drop down on the other side.  Run over to the dead end (it's marked
with a sign which reads "Dead End").  Bomb the boulder to reveal a small
tunnel.  Crawl through the tunnel to find another Great Fairy's Fountain.

---------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Great Fairy's Fountain
New Item: Din's Fire

Run to the Fountain, and stand on the Triforce Emblem.  Play Zelda's Lullaby on
the Ocarina to make another Dominatrix appear.  She'll give you Din's Fire, an
area of effect spell which burns all enemies in the room (and can also light
large numbers of braziers at the same time).  Return through the cave mouth.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Garden

Allow one of the guards to spot you, and you will be thrown back out to the
gate.  Return to Hyrule Castle Market.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market

One of the shops in the Market which was closed on your last visit, is now
open.  Go to the left side of the Market, and enter the building with the large
poster, whose door is at the foot of the long stairset.

--------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Bombchu Bowling Alley
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP10]
New Equipment: Bomb Bag x40
New Item: Bombchus

This minigame has no less then three new things to win (Piece of Heart, Bomb
Bag and Bombchus), and isn't cheap to play.  You may have to return to the
Hyrule Castle Gatehouse or do the Drawbridge Rupee Trick multiple times before
you finally get all three rewards.  It isn't imperative that you get the
Bombchus, but you'll probably end up winning them trying to get the Bomb Bag
and the Piece of Heart anyway.  Pay the clerk 30 rupees to play the game.

The object of Bombchu Bowling is to send the Bombchu (a mobile bomb) into the
hole on the opposite end of the course.  The course has three different goals
to obtain, each one becoming progressively more difficult.  Completing all
three goals successfully will win you whatever prize the clerk showed you at
the start.

For the first goal, the target is always in the center of the field.  Simply
stand in the exact middle of the field (slightly to the right of the center
arrow is the exact middle of the field) and time it so your Bombchu avoids the
Blade Trap.  The next level of the field can be on the top, left, or right, and
adds a small Cucco to dodge.  The Cucco isn't as predictable as the Blade Trap
in it's movements, but is so small it almost isn't an issue.  The last goal is
always in the exact center, and adds a Fat Cucco who always stands roughly in
the center of the field (but you can sneak a Bombchu by it if you're careful).

When you're playing Bombchu Bowling, always position yourself in the center of
the field.  The one exception is when the target appears on the right in the
second round; you have to minorly adjust your position to the left or right,
otherwise it's impossible to angle yourself properly for the Bombchu to enter
the target.  If the hole appears on the left side of the field, then adjust
your angle so that the Bombchu goes along the floor, then the wall, then into
the hole.  For holes in the center or top of the playing field, simply wait
until all of the targets are in the right position, and send a Bombchu straight
down the middle.  Absolutely never play anywhere except in the exact center of
the field (again, except for when the target appears on the right in the second
round).  Bombchu Bowling is, ultimately, more a game of patience and timing
then luck.

Once you have at least the Piece of Heart and the Bomb Bag, you can leave.  As
I already said, the Bombchus are entirely optional.

---------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market (daytime)

If you're doing the Happy Mask Trading Sequence, then head for the Happy Mask
Shop.  If you're not going to do it, then head for Zora's River, which is in
Hyrule Field at the 2:00 position, and skip down to the heading marked Zora's
River.

------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop (daytime)
New Item: Spooky Mask

Pay the 20 rupees for the Skull Mask, then borrow the Spooky Mask.  Return to
Kakariko Village and go to the Graveyard.

-----------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard (daytime)

If it's nighttime, play the Sun's Song to change it to Day.  Speak with Dampe's
Fanboy (the little kid who walks around the graves during the day) while
wearing the Spooky Mask, and he'll buy it from you for 30 rupees.  Now, let's
return to Hyrule Castle Market and get the last Happy Mask.  Return to the
Happy Mask Shop in Hyrule Castle Market.

------------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop (daytime)
New Item: Bunny Hood

Pay the 30 rupees for the Spooky Mask, then borrow the Bunny Hood.  Now it's
time to catch up with those lazy people who don't bother to do the Happy Mask
Trading Sequence.  Return to Hyrule Field.

Hyrule Field

We're now headed for Zora's River.  It's a small passage at the 2:00 position
in Hyrule Field, a short ways upstream from Kakariko Village.  The entrance is
the same pond that Link stops Epona at to drink in the game's demo sequence on
the title screen.

-------------
Zora's River
New Items: Magic Beans
New Upgrades: Piece of Heart x2 [HP11] [HP12]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS024] [GS025]

Run forward a few feet, and Kaepora Gaebora will stop you to barrage you with
another wall of text.  After he's gone, roll into the tree to make a Gold
Skulltula appear.  Kill it and take it's Token, then bomb the stones blocking
the path.  Follow the river upstream until you reach an iron gate.  Speak to
the fat slob-like guy, and buy as many Magic Beans from him as you can.  They
become progressively more expensive as you buy more; just keep buying them
until you go broke.

Plant one of the Magic Beans in the patch of soft earth next to the Bean Man.
Don't bother dropping a bug in this one; this is the only earthy patch in the
game which doesn't have a Gold Skulltula.  Run back a ways to where the river
bends.  There is a patch of dirt here, and a patch of dirt on the other side,
indicating where some kind of bridge used to exist.  Jump across the gap to
reach the other side of the river.

Keep going upriver, and ignore the Octorok who appears.  Jump over the small
gap in the river, then run up to where there is a small hill on the left.  Run
up this hill, and jump over the small gap.  Hang a right, then run until you
hit a wall, then go right again.  Drop down off the cliff here, then run
forward.  There is a log leading into the river here; carefully jump onto the
log, and walk slowly to the edge of the log where there is a small, white
circle.  Stand on this circle, and pull out your Ocarina.

Play the Frogs each of the four songs that you have learned so far (Zelda's
Lullaby, Epona's Song, The Sun's Song and Saria's Song).  The frogs will award
you with fifty rupees for each song.  After you have played all four songs,
return to the Bean Man and keep buying Magic Beans from him until you go broke
again.  To reach the Bean Man, just jump into the river and ride it downstream,
and get back onto dry land at the shallow part on the left near the Octorok.

You were probably only able to buy five or six beans.  This is okay; we'll come
back later to buy the rest of them once we have the Adult's Wallet.  From the
Bean Man, turn around.  You'll see a Cucco running around a circle of rocks.
Grab the Cucco, and return to the Musical Frogs.  You'll see a Piece of Heart
sitting on a pillar on the way; this is what we're going for with the Cucco.

From the Musical Frogs, run forward, and throw the Cucco up the cliff.
Immediately jump up and grab it quickly - if it runs into the water, it will
disappear and respawn back at the beginning of the area.  Turn to the right,
and run into the river (it's shallow enough that you won't be swept away).
Throw the Cucco up to the next cliff level, and quickly jump up after it and
grab it before it goes into the water.  Run to the south edge of this cliff,
where there is a small waterfall.  If you look downstream, you will see a small
ledge sitting just above the water line.  Jump out holding the Cucco, and glide
down to the ledge.  Throw the Cucco away; we won't be needing this one anymore.

Climb the ladder.  At the top, note the Cucco running around.  Grab it, and run
to the northern edge.  Jump over to the cliff with the Gossip Stone on it, then
turn to the west to see the tall pillar with the Piece of Heart on it.  You'll
have to jump out with the Cucco, and land on the pillar to get the Piece of
Heart.

Grabbing the Piece of Heart will make you drop the Cucco, who will probably run
away.  The bad news is, we need a Cucco still.  Jump into the river and ride it
downstream back to the beginning of the area.  Grab the Cucco near the Bean
Man, and return to the small waterfall (where we leapt off to reach the small
ledge).

With the Cucco over your head, run to the east, across the shallow riverbed and
up the hill.  Go across the wooden bridge, and around the corner where you will
find a large waterfall.  Take a right up the zigzagging path, and jump down to
the lower path.  Go to the right, up and around, and then to the left, across
the plaque, until you hit the wall.  Look to the left, and you will see another
Piece of Heart.  Leap off with the Cucco over your head, and you will glide out
to the Piece of Heart (which should complete your eighth Heart Container).

You're done with the Cuccos now.  There's still one more Gold Skulltula Token
to get before we enter Zora's Domain.  If it's daytime, play the Sun's Song to
make it night (time passes normally in this zone, so you won't warp back to the
entrance).  From the platform that you picked the Piece of Heart from, drop
straight down, where you will see a ladder rising from the river bed to the
zigzagging path.  A Gold Skulltula climbs on it. Kill the Skulltula with the
Slingshot, and climb up the ladder to take it's Token.

From the top of the ladder, go around the zigzagging path, and stand on the
plaque before the waterfall.  Play Zelda's Lullaby, and the waterfall will
retract, letting you access the doorway behind it.  Jump over to the doorway
and go through to enter Zora's Domain.

--------------
Zora's Domain
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP13]
New Equipment: Silver Scale

Hug the wall on the right, and keep following the path until it splits to the
left and right.  Go left.  At the top is the King Zora, who has to be one of
the fattest fish-persons you'll ever see.  Look to the left as you enter his
"throne room," and you'll find a torch.  Light it with your Deku Stick, and
quickly run back down the stairs and light the torch you find there with the
Deku Stick.  Pull out a new Deku Stick, and light it again.

Run down the stone path, and take a left down the path we passed earlier.
Light the burned-out brazier next to the cave mouth around the corner, and keep
going forward through the shallow water to light another brazier.  Put away
your Deku Stick, and run to the left to a small alcove behind the waterfall,
where there are two more braziers.  Use Din's Fire to light them both.  If you
did it fast enough so that you lit all the braziers without any of them burning
out, then a chest will appear behind the Waterfall which contains a Piece of
Heart.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, return to the King's Throne Room.  Run down
the tunnel to the left of the king, and at the end you'll find a Zora.  Play
the Diving Minigame with him for 20 rupees (you need it's reward, the Silver
Scale, to progress).  If you don't have twenty rupees, then return to the
Zora's River area and ride downstream to pick up invisible rupees from the
riverbed.

The Diving Minigame is relatively easy.  The Zora will throw a handful of
rupees off the waterfall, which you need to dive down and grab.  Simply
position yourself above the rupees, and hold down A as you dive down to grab
them.  Once you get better at it, you can grab multiple rupees in one dive.
Once you have grabbed all of the rupees from around the waterfall, the Zora
will call down for you to return to him and he'll give you a reward.  He'll
give you the Silver Scale, which doubles how deep you can go in a single dive.

Once you have the Silver Scale, dive off the waterfall again, and head for the
area slightly south of the waterfall.  There is a tunnel under the water here.
Dive down and enter this tunnel to warp to Lake Hylia.

-----------
Lake Hylia
New Item: Bottle #3
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltulla Token x2 [GS026] [GS027]

There's a ton to do here in Lake Hylia, so let's get through it quickly.  The
first thing, is to swim a short ways south from where you emerge from the
tunnel from Zora's Domain.  On the floor of the lake, near a ruined pillar,
there is a Bottle.  Dive down and grab it.  You'll find that the Bottle already
contains a Letter!  This is actually the SOS sent by the Princess Ruto, who is
trapped inside Lord Jabu Jabu, the Zora demigod.  You're going to want to take
this back to King Zora, but not immediately.  There's still plenty to do here.

Swim north, back to the shore, and head for the east coast, where there are two
small gardens with two scarecrows in them.  Show the Scarecrow in the lower
garden your Ocarina, and he'll ask you to play a song for him.  Play the
easiest eight-note song you can come up with, and don't play any of the songs
you have learned or will learn later.  Make sure the song has at least two
different notes.  Write this song down somewhere; you're going to need it
later.

Head west to the tall building, and look for a patch of soft earth near it.
Release a Bug from your Bottle near the patch of earth (remember to recapture
one), and kill the Gold Skulltula that appears.  Take it's token, then plant
one of your Magic Beans.  Go around to the west side of the building, and cross
the wooden bridge that stretched across the Lake.

Ignore Kaepora Gaebora here; he'll give you a lift to Hyrule Castle, but you
don't want to be going there.  Keep going along the wooden bridge to the large
island with the ancient dead tree on it.  You'll also find another one of those
mysterious platforms, like the one you saw in the Sacred Forest Meadow.  Look
east from the tree, and you'll see a small island with two pillars on it.  Swim
out to this island, and change the time to nighttime.  A Gold Skulltulla will
appear.  Kill it and take it's Token.

Look to the north, where you will see a small island.  Swim to the island, and
enter the door built into the wall.

--------------------------
Lake Hylia - Fishing Pond
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP14]

Speak with the Clerk to the right, and pay him 20 rupees to play the Fishing
Minigame.  He'll explain the fishing process to you.

In order to win the Piece of Heart, you have to capture a record breaking fish:
nine pounds.  There really isn't much advice that can be given for this.  It's
all about patience.  Z-Target a fish, then hit B to cast.  Use the B button,
the A button and the joystick to play with the lure and attract fish to the
fly.  The biggest fish are found near the submerged log on the left side of the
pond and the reeds on the right.  Once a fish is on the line, hold down A and
pull backwards on the control stick to reel the fish in.  With that information
in hand, get fishing.

Once you have captured a nine-pound fish (minimum), return to the Clerk and
show him your fish.  He'll give you a Piece of Heart.  Leave the Fishing Pond.

-----------
Lake Hylia

We're going to take a quick detour over to Gerudo Valley while we're here.
There's never really any reason for Young Link to ever go there aside from the
optional upgrades you can get there, so now is a good time as any as while
we're in the neighborhood.

Head north out of Lake Hylia to return to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP36]

Climb the ladder onto the wall on the left.  Run along the wall, and jump off
to the right at it's end to land in the center of the small fenced-in corral.
After Kaepora Gaebora is done telling you what a Lake is, move to the exact
center of the corral and drop a bomb to reveal a pit.  Use the Stone of Agony
with the Rumble Pak to find it easier, if you have one.  Drop down into the pit
that appears, and defeat the Business Scrub inside.  The Scrub will offer to
sell you a Piece of Heart for ten rupees.  That's not a typo.  Ten rupees.  Buy
the Heart Piece, then return to Hyrule Field.

Jump out of the corral, and head northwest until you hit the road.  Ignore any
Peahats who you may attract on the way.  After another meeting with Kaepora
Gaebora, go west into a rocky, canyon-like area.  Keep going west through the
canyon until you reach the zone break to Gerudo Valley.

Gerudo Valley
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x2 [HP15] [HP16]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS028]

Run forward a short ways, and along the log bridge.  Grab the Cucco on the
other side of the log bridge, and then run to the edge of the canyon.  Look to
the opposite side of the canyon, and try to spot a small platform with a wooden
crate on it.  Once you have found it, jump out to it with the Cucco.

Glide slowly down to the crate, and then toss the Cucco into the wall.  Roll
into the crate to destroy it, and immediately pick up the Cucco again.  If you
do it fast enough, then the Cucco won't have time to jump into the river.  If
you miss it, then you'll have to jump down into the river, ride it downstream
to Lake Hylia, and then return to Gerudo Valley so you can get another Cucco.
Fun!

Grab the Piece of Heart that was in the crate, which will cause you to drop the
Cucco again.  Hurry through the Piece of Heart victory text as fast as you can,
and quickly pick up the Cucco again.  If you miss it, then you'll have to jump
into the river, ride it downstream to Lake Hylia, and then return to Gerudo
Valley so you can get another Cucco.  Fun!

From the platform with the Piece of Heart in the crate, face north, where you
will see a narrow strip of land far below.  Jump off, hugging the left wall.
Ride the Cucco all the way down.  It's a long way, but just be patient.  Once
you touch down on the narrow strip of land, toss the Cucco against the wall, as
far away from the river as possible.  You're still going to need it in a
moment.  Head for the southern edge of this strip of land, look for the patch
of soft earth near the Cow.

Release some Bugs near the patch of soft earth.  Remember to recapture one of
the three bugs that comes out. Kill the Gold Skulltula that appears, and take
it's Token.  Plant the Magic Beans in the soft earth, then grab the Cucco.  If
it has run off the edge into the river, then you'll have to dive into the
river, which will take you down to Lake Hylia, and run all the way back around
to Gerudo Valley, so you can grab the Cucco again.  Fun!

Once you have the Cucco and are back on the stretch of land, run to it's
northern edge.  Look behind the waterfall, and you will see a ladder.  Jump out
to the ladder, and don't drop the Cucco until you're pressing your face right
up next to it.  Luckily, there is no current in the area immediately behind the
waterfall, so you can climb up onto it if you fall in the water.  Climb to the
top of the ladder, where you will find another Piece of Heart.  Take it, then
jump into the river and ride it downstream to return to Lake Hylia.

-----------
Lake Hylia

Swim to the submerged ruins near the shore, to the east of the Observatory and
the west of the Scarecrows.  Dive into the water and swim into the tunnel to
return to Zora's Domain.

--------------
Zora's Domain

Return to King Zora's Throne Room, and show him the Bottled Letter.  He'll
then, uh... "move" aside, and beg Link to save his daughter from Jabu Jabu's
Belly.  We'll get to that in a moment.  For now, return to the bottom level of
Zora's Domain, and go to the area of shallow water near the waterfall.  Catch
one of the fish who swim around here in an empty Bottle.  Return to King Zora's
Throne room, and go on the narrow path on the right side of the chamber to
reach his throne.  Go through the tunnel behind his throne to reach Zora's
Fountain.

----------------
Zora's Fountain
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS029]

This area is largely structured around the Zora Demigod, Jabu Jabu.  We'll get
to him in a moment; for now, swim to the island in the very southeast part of
the Fountain.  Roll into the tree to find a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take
it's token.  Drop a bomb between the two boulders against the wall, and the
wall will explode open revealing a massive cave opening.  Go through the cave
to find your third Great Fairy's Fountain.

-----------------------
Great Fairy's Fountain
New Item: Farore's Wind

Run forward to the fountain, stand on the Triforce emblem and play Zelda's
Lullaby to make the Dominatrix appear.  This time, you'll get Farore's Wind, a
spell which lets you set checkpoints in Dungeons.  You'll probably use it
exactly zero times in your entire quest.

Once you have Farore's Wind, leave the Fairy Fountain.

----------------
Zora's Fountain

Go to the west side of the area, and climb up onto the altar in front of Jabu
Jabu.  Stand directly in front of his mouth, and use the Fish you captured in
the Bottle.  Jabu Jabu will inhale you right along with the Fish.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jabu-Jabu's Belly is easily the game's strangest and most unorthodox dungeons,
and contains some of the first truly "difficult" puzzles in the game (though
it's nothing compared to the puzzles that appear in Master Quest).  In the
dungeon, players must try to activate an elevator in Jabu-Jabu's throat, which
leads to the boss' chamber.  This is easier said then done, however, as several
areas of Jabu-Jabu's Belly are blocked by parasitic tentacles, which must be
destroyed first.  Players will loop constantly through old rooms in trying to
clear the dungeon.

------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Entrance

Run forward a few feet, and a pair of Octoroks will appear on the left and
right.  Kill them with your Slingshot, then use Deku Nuts to kill the Shaboms
(the floating bubble enemies).  Run to the north end of the room and shoot the
large yellow bump on the ceiling with your Slingshot.  The "door" at the end of
the hall will unseal.  Go through it.

-----------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Elevator Room

There is a new, floating jellyfish-like enemy in this room called a "Biri."
It's immune to all of your weapons at the moment, so for now we're just going
to ignore any of them we come across.  If a Biri gets too close, use a Deku Nut
to stun it.  You actually can then kill it with your sword once it's stunned,
but it's far easier to just avoid them.

Run around the left side, following the platform, and enter the door on the
other side.

------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Pit Room

Take a few steps into the room, and you'll find Princess Ruto, safe and sound.
But she won't be happy to see you, and runs away, falling through a pit in the
floor.  Follow her down through the same pit.

Speak with her when you land, and she'll accidentally let slip that she lost a
sacred stone in Jabu-Jabu's belly.  Speak with her again, and she'll agree to
come with you, but only if you help her find her stone first.  You now get the
privilege of carrying Ruto around with you everywhere you go.

Pick Ruto up, then leave through the east door, which should be behind you as
you land from the upper level.

--------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Water Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS030]

Drop Ruto, and kill the Shaboms in the hallway with Deku Nuts.  Pick Ruto up
again, and run to the hall's end.  Jump down into the pit, but be very careful
that you don't step on the switch in the middle of the room.  The water level
will rise, and Ruto (who doesn't like water... go figure) will return to the
Pit Room.  Throw Ruto up onto the ledge on the north side of the room, then
kill the enemies in the pit with you.

Use Deku Nuts to make the Stingers (the submerged enemies whose fins you can
see) jump up, and kill them with the Slingshot.  Once you have killed all of
the Stingers, turn to the "ivy" covered wall to the west.  Kill the Gold
Skulltula on the wall with the Slingshot.  Next, jump onto the switch, and the
water level will rise.  Climb onto the "ivy" on the west wall, and up into the
alcove, grabbing the Token on the way.

Destroy the pots in the alcove to find a Fairy and some Seeds.  Capture the
fairy in an empty bottle if you have one, then jump down back into the pit.
Step onto the switch again to make the water level rise, then get onto the
northern ledge where you threw Ruto earlier.

Pick up Ruto, then run into the hall.  Kill more Shaboms with Deku Nuts, then
shoot the switch on the ceiling with your Slingshot (or you can even use Ruto
to nail the switch if you're feeling sadistic.  The door at the end of the hall
will unlock.  Go through it.

-----------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Elevator Room

Wait for the elevator to come down.  Kill the Octorok if you have to.  Get on
the elevator, and ride it to the top of the Pit Room while carrying Ruto.  If
you're wondering, the submerged tunnel leads to a Business Scrub who sells
overpriced Deku Nuts.

Look to the right at the top of the elevator, and go through the door back to
the Pit Room.

------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Pit Room

Run straight across the room to the opposite door, avoiding Biri and the pits
in the floor.  If you fall down, you'll have to go back around through the
Water Room and back up the Elevator Room.  As you pass through the Pit Room,
take note of the pit covered by the gigantic green tentacle.  Once we get rid
of that tentacle, we'll be dropping down that hole.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Crawling Hallway

Just run past any enemies you encounter in this hallway.  It's far easier to
avoid them then to fight them.  If you must, then Z-target them and use basic
Sword techniques.  Run to the right, and step onto the yellow switch while
carrying Ruto.  Normally, your weight alone wouldn't be enough, but with Ruto's
help then the switch will activate.  Go through the unlocked door in front of
the switch.

----------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Stinger Room
New Item: Boomerang

You probably can't tell, but this room is crawling with Stingers.  Use Deku
Nuts or run in front of their paths to reveal them.  Kill them with your
Slingshot.  Once they are all dead, a chest will appear.  Open it to find the
Boomerang, an important weapon for Young Link.  This will help you to kill the
Biris, as well as remove those troublesome tentacles that have been appearing
throughout the dungeon.  Most importantly, however, it lets you claim Skulltula
Tokens from a range, finally giving you access to those troublesome Gold
Skulltulas you may have seen lurking in high places.

Boomerang in hand, pick up Ruto and return through the door.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Crawling Hallway

Run straight down the hallway to it's opposite end.  You will see a blue switch
in front of a door.  Jump onto the switch while carrying Ruto, and it will
press down.  However, if you step off the switch then it will rise again.
You'll have to leave Ruto behind on the switch, by stepping down on it, then
pressing A to leave Ruto on it.  Go through the door once you've jammed the
button, leaving Ruto behind.

------------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Orange Tentacle Room
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

This room contains a very long parasitic tentacle.  No, it's not a...
nevermind.  It's a tentacle.  Z-Target it, and use your Boomerang to attack the
narrow segment near the base of the tentacle.  It will then retract into the
wall.  You need to strike that segment three more times with the boomerang.  To
do so, run forward until the Tentacle stretches and makes a swishing noise,
meaning it is about to strike.  Release the Boomerang at this exact moment
while running backwards, and you will avoid damage and strike the tentacle.
Repeat two more times to kill it.  Killing the Orange Tentacle will remove all
of the other orange tentacles blocking passage to other areas of the dungeon.

A chest will appear once the Tentacle dies, open it to find the Dungeon Map.
Return to the Crawling Hallway.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Crawling Hallway

Ruto will be waiting for you on the other side of the door.  She'll give you a
right ol' telling off for leaving her behind.  Pick the royal pain up, then go
to the left from the blue switch.  This door is now unblocked.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Shabom Room
New Dungeon Item: Compass

This room requires you to kill a pack of Shaboms in forty seconds.  Easy even
using the Slingshot, but a piece of cake with Deku Nuts.  Use both to defeat
all of the Shaboms.  A chest will appear upon their demise.  Open it to find
the Compass.  Pick Ruto up and return to the Crawling Hallway.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Crawling Hallway

Go down the hall, take a left, go straight, then left again.  Go through the
door.

----------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Blue Tentacle Room

This room contains another tentacle.  The fight is identical to the fight
against the Orange Tentacle.  Hit it with the boomerang, run forward to make it
strike at you, then hit it with the boomerang again while dodging the attack.
Hit it four times to kill it.  All of the Blue Tentacles around the dungeon
will now disappear.  Pick up Ruto and return to the Crawling Hallway.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Crawling Hallway

Go right down the hall, then take another right.  Go through the door at the
end of the hall.

----------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Green Tentacle Room

In addition to a very large green tentacle, this room also has a number of
Biri.  The Biri are no problem now that you have a Boomerang, however.
Eliminate the Biri first, then turn your attention to the Tentacle.  Hit it
with the boomerang, run forward to make it strike at you, then hit it with the
boomerang again while dodging the attack.  Hit it four times to kill it.  All
of the Green Tentacles around the dungeon will now disappear.  Pick up Ruto and
return to the Crawling Hallway.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Crawling Hallway

Run straight across the hallway back to the Pit Room.

------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Pit Room
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS031] [GS032]

If you'll remember, the last time you were in here I told you to note where a
large tentacle was covering a pit.  Now that we've gotten rid of all the
tentacles in the dungeon, we are now free to drop down that pit.  If you
weren't paying attention the last time you were here, the pit is the one
closest to the west wall, to the right as you come in from the Crawling
Hallway.  Drop down this pit.

When you land, set down Ruto and face the north.  You will see not one, but two
Gold Skulltulas on the wall.  Kill them both with the Boomerang, then use the
Boomerang again to claim their Tokens.  When manually aiming the Boomerang, use
Link's head as a targeting reticule.  Once you have both of the Tokens, pick up
Ruto and go through the door to the west.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Bigocto

When you enter the room, Ruto will see her Stone sitting on a ledge.  Throw her
up onto the ledge so that she can claim it.  However, the ledge will
immediately rise up - it's actually an elevator!  When the elevator comes back
down, Ruto is gone.  And a new friend has arrived.

The Bigocto is a really easy fight, it can just take some time to do it.  His
weakpoint is a large green "eye" on his backside.  The Bigocto is vulnerable to
the Boomerang - it stuns him and locks him in place.  To gain access to
Bigocto's backside, you must stun him with the Boomerang, then begin running
around to his backside by circling around the large platform in the middle of
the room.  After he recovers from the stun, the Bigocto will begin running in a
random direction.  If he begins to run towards you, then you'll have to stun
him again and start over.  If he runs in the same direction as you, then keep
circling until you reach his backside (it can take a while - try to hug as
close to the inner wall as you can).  Once you have reached his backside, stun
him with the Boomerang, and use a Jump Attack to damage his green eye.  Two
Jump Attacks will defeat the Bigocto.

Another alternative is to simply let him run into you.  He will then turn
around, letting you stun him and attack him.  This is less glamorous and
sloppier, but works much more quickly and easily.

After the Bigocto is dead, step onto the middle platform and the elevator will
rise.  Ruto is still gone.  You'll have to find her if you want that Spiritual
Stone.  Run south down the hall and through the door, killing any Biri who get
in your way.

-------------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Pink Thing Room

This room has two "Pink Things" in it.  You'll have to run across them to reach
the next door.  Unfortunately, the only way to get across them is to stun them
with the Boomerang.  Stun the first one with the Boomerang, then jump out onto
it.  Then stun the second one, then jump to the door.  Go through the door.  If
the Octorok gets in your way, kill it.

-----------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Elevator Room

Run forward, and jump across to the platform on the opposite wall.  The ledge
will immediately lower, showing yourself to be right next door to the Dungeon's
entrance.  Note the blue switch in front of you as the ledge comes to a stop.
Run around to the door by the Pit Room and grab one of the boxes, then step
onto the blue button.  The button will depress.  Drop the box so that it sits
on the button, forcing it to stay activated.  Go through the door.

-------------------------------------
Inside Jabu-Jabu's Belly - Biri Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS033]

Kill all of the Biri around the room, then go around to the southeast side of
the room.  Kill the Gold Skulltula on the ivy wall, and climb up to take it's
token.  Climb all the way up the ivy wall to the platform at it's top.  At the
top, look to the right to see a switch.  Z-Target it and use the Boomerang to
hit it.  The door in the north end of the room will unlock.  Jump down and go
through it.

-----------B-O-S-S------------
Bio-Electric Anemone BARINADE
New Upgrade: Heart Container x1
New Quest Item: Zora Sapphire

Barinade is by no means a difficult boss, but he is the first boss in the game
who has a real chance at killing you.

In Barinade's first form, he is attached to the floor and ceiling by his roots
and tentacles.  His main attack in this form is to shoot bolts of lightning at
you with the "satellite dishes" on his head.  Z-Target the tentacles attached
to the ceiling, and begin circling the boss.  It doesn't matter what direction
you choose to circle in, but stick with it.  Changing course will result in you
getting electrocuted.  Destroy the tentacles attached to the ceiling with the
Boomerang.

Once you have destroyed the tentacles attached to the ceiling, the boss enters
phase two.  The Baris attached to Barinade's base will detach and begin
circling the boss in some kind of giant carousel.  Dodge through the circling
Biris, and stun the boss by striking it's base with the Boomerang.  The Baris
will release from their bonding to Barinade, and become vulnerable.  Destroy
them with your Boomerang.  After a short time, the Bari will reattach
themselves and begin circling again.  Repeat until all of the Bari are
destroyed.

The boss now enters phase three.  This is essentially the same as phase two,
except that the boss is now capable of moving about the room and the ring of
Baris is much smaller and faster.  Keep throwing your Boomerang at Barinade
until it can penetrate the fast moving Baris, and it will stun him.  Destroy
the Baris.  Be careful while destroying them, as the "satellite dishes" will
resume their attacking.

Once all of the Baris are dead, then you enter the boss' final phase, in which
you are finally able to damage him.  Stun him with your Boomerang, then run
into strike it's base with Jump Attacks.  Watch out, however - the satellite
dishes will keep on firing the whole time.  After two Jump Attacks, Barinade
will retreat into the ground briefly.  Keep dodging the Satellite Dishes until
he emerges from the ground, then resume stunning and damaging him.  After five
Jump Attacks, Barinade will be defeated.

Take the Heart Container that Barinade leaves behind, then enter the ring of
shimmering blue light.  Ruto waits for you here, along with the Zora Sapphire.
The ring will teleport you and Ruto outside.  Ruto will give you the Zora
Sapphire, but only if you agree to marry her.  She doesn't give you much choice
in the matter (if it makes you feel any better, you get out of the engagement
later).

Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)

----------------------------
Zora's Fountain (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS034]

Before we continue on with our journey, we're going to be doing a ton of stuff.
We'll be returning to just about every area we've visited so far, to claim
(among other things) new Pieces of Heart and a large number of Gold Skulltula
Tokens.  If you want to skip all of this, then proceed to Hyrule Castle and
follow the instructions that the game gives you.  Once you've retrieved the
Ocarina of Time from the Hyrule Castle Moat and learned the Song of Time, then
head for the Temple of Time and scroll down to the part of the guide with the
heading "Temple of Time."

If it isn't nighttime, play the Sun's Song to make it so.  Climb up onto the
large tree trunk which arches over the body of water in the south of the zone.
Go to the west side of the tree trunk and look on the wall to see a Gold
Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token with your Boomerang.  Head back through
the cave entrance in the west side of the zone to return to Zora's Domain.

--------------
Zora's Domain

From King Zora's Throne Room, go to the right and dive off of the waterfall.
Swim down into the water and into the tunnel to Lake Hylia.

-----------------------
Lake Hylia (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS035]

Swim back up to the shore, and go to the west a short ways to the observatory.
Make it nighttime with the Sun's Song if you need to, then head around to the
back side of the Observatory.  Look on the rear side of the observatory from
the wooden drawbridge to find a Gold Skulltula.  Use the Boomerang to kill it
and claim it's token.  Head to Hyrule Field through the north exit.

-------------
Hyrule Field
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS036]

Head north and climb up the ladder onto the stone wall.  Run along the wall and
jump off it's other side, then go north until you reach the road.  Follow the
road northwest, and ignore any Peahat you may anger along the way.  Turn left
at the giant tree.  Head into the quarry-like area, and go the north edge of it
to find a circle of stones.  Drop a bomb in the middle of this circle of stones
to find a hidden pit.  Drop down into the pit.

Use Din's Fire to burn away all of the webbing to reveal three alcoves with a
Big Skulltula, a Cow and a Gossip Stone in each.  Head for the alcove with the
cow, and look on the wall in the rear of the alcove to find a Gold Skulltula.
Kill it and take it's token with the Boomerang.  Return to the surface by
entering the beam of light.

Go west to enter Gerudo Valley.

--------------------------
Gerudo Valley (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS037]

Go west, and go halfway up the log bridge.  Stop halfway along it.  Make it
nighttime with the Sun's Song if you need to, then turn to the right.  Look
just above the small waterfall to find a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's
token with the Boomerang.

Head out to the drawbridge west of the log bridge and dive into the river.
Ride it down stream back to Lake Hylia and use the underwater passage to return
to Zora's Domain.

--------------
Zora's Domain

Climb up to the path that leads to the front entrance, return to Zora's River,
and ride it downstream back to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS038]

Head for Kakariko Village, in the northeast corner of the zone, at 1:00 on the
clock face.  Before you enter the Village, go north from the stairs to find a
lone tree in the very northeast corner of the field.  Place a bomb on the north
side of the tree to blast open a pit.  Drop down.

Run to the end of the pit and kill the Big Skulltula.  Look high on the wall,
where a Gold Skulltula rests on a bit of webbing.  Kill the Gold Skulltula and
take it's token with your Boomerang.  Return through the beam of light to
Hyrule Field, enter Kakariko Village and head for the House of Skulltula.

-------------------
House of Skulltula
New Equipment: Giant's Wallet

Speak with the man in the rear of the room, and he'll award you for killing 30
Gold Skulltulas with the Giant's Wallet.  This is the largest wallet in the
game, which can hold up to 500 rupees.  Leave the house back to Kakariko
Village and head for the Graveyard.

-------------------------------
Kakariko Graveyard (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS039]

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to.  Head for the
southeast corner of the graveyard, to the far south end of the second row of
gravestones.  Look high on the wall to see another Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and
take it's token with the Boomerang.  Now, head for the northwest corner of the
graveyard where there is a soft patch of earth.  Plant one of your Magic Beans
there.  Return to Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

From Kakariko Graveyard, take a right up the long staircase.  Enter the door on
the right at the top of the stairs, behind the crate to enter the Windmill.

------------------
Kakariko Windmill
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP17]

Look to the left as you enter to see a Piece of Heart high on a ledge.  Get
closer to it and use the Boomerang to snag it.  Remember to use Link's head as
a targeting reticule.  Return to the Village and go to Death Mountain Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail

Re-equip your Hylian Shield if you're not using it already.  Start heading up
the trail and enter the mouth of Dodongo's Cavern.  Plant one of your Magic
Beans in the soft patch of earth, then enter the Cavern.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

If you like, use Farore's Wind at the start of the dungeon so that you can warp
right back to the start as soon as you have claimed the Gold Skulltula.

There are still two Gold Skulltulas in this dungeon which you are yet to reach,
and we're going to get one of them right now.  The other, we're going to have
to return even later for.  To reach this Skulltula, we're going to have to go
through part of the dungeon in reverse order then the first time you were here.
You're going to do this by using the elevator in the Antechamber to reach the
second floor.  It isn't so bad, it'll be over real quick.

Head into the main chamber, out to in front of the giant Dodongo's head.  Board
the moving platform on the right and ride it to the top.  Get off on the second
floor, and enter the tunnel opposite the plaque.

-----------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Blade Trap Room

Jump off the cliff to the right as you enter the room to drop down to the
bottom level.  Dodge the blade trap and climb the ladder near the southwest
corner of the room.  Go through the tunnel back to the Antechamber.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

Cross the wooden bridge and enter the door on the opposite side.  Kill any Fire
Keese who bother you.

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Pillar Room

Kill the Fire Keese, then pull aside the Armos Statue blocking the ladder on
the south side of the room.  Step on the switch on top of the pillar to unlock
the doors, then leave through the north door.

------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Bomb Flower Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS040]

Go left or right around the perimeter of the room, being careful not to fall.
If you do, you'll have to loop all the way back around.  Climb up the ivy walls
to the top of the iron platform.  Look into the alcove on the north side of the
room, and use the Boomerang to kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token.
Drop down to the bottom floor and leave the Dungeon.  Return to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Head southwest to Lon Lon Ranch.  Enter the Ranch.  Be careful of passing too
close to Hyrule Castle, unless you want to progress the game's plot ahead of
where this guide is.

--------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS041] [GS042]

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to.  Head towards the arch
leading into the field, and stop to look at the second story window on the left
building.  Kill the Gold Skulltula on the window, and take it's token with the
Boomerang.  Head out into the field, towards the southwest wall, to the right
of the mill.  Kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token with the Boomerang,
then return to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field
New Item: Ocarina of Time
New Song: Song of Time

If you've been skipping the Happy Mask Trading Sequence, then start heading for
Hyrule Castle now and skip the next two paragraphs.  Unfortunately, if you have
been skipping out on it then you're going to miss a Deku Nut upgrade and 500
easy rupees.  Another bad thing: this 500 rupees is going to be contributed to
buying the remaining Magic Beans that you still need to buy.

If you want to catch up on the Happy Mask trading sequence, then there's a
special subchapter for it.  Return to the table of contents to find the Find
Code.

The man we're looking for is now running in a wide circle around Hyrule Field.
He sticks primarily to the road and runs counter-clockwise, so if you do the
same and run clockwise then you'll quickly find him.  You now must chase him
until he stops running - he takes periodic breaks, and the Sun's Song is no
help.  Once he has stopped, speak to him while wearing the Bunny Hood, and he
will give you 500 rupees for it.  If you don't have the Giant's Wallet yet,
then you're going to miss out on the majority of these.  Once you have sold the
Bunny Hood, head for Hyrule Castle.

Head for the gates to Hyrule Castle, which will remain firmly shut in either
daytime or nighttime.  When you get close enough, a cut scene will take place.
Zelda and Impa will race out of the gates, and Zelda will do a really fantastic
John Elway impression by throwing you the Ocarina of Time, which will land in
the moat.  You then get your first face-to-face encounter with Ganondorf.

After the cutscene is over, dive into the water of the moat to get the Ocarina
of Time, at which point Zelda will contact you telepathically and teach you the
Song of Time.  When you emerge from the telepathic contact, you will be back
out front of Hyrule Castle.  Enter the castle and go to the Happy Mask Shop.

--------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Happy Mask Shop
New Item: Mask of Truth

Speak with the mask trader, and pay him fifty rupees for the Bunny Hood.  You
have now finished the entire Happy Mask Trading sequence, and can borrow any
Mask that you want from the store.  For now, take the Mask of Truth, which lets
you get hints from the Gossip Stones around the world, and also gets you a Deku
Nut upgrade.  Head back to Hyrule Field.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Now that your Giant's Wallet is overflowing with rupees, it's time to spend
most of them on Magic Beans.  Return to Zora's River, in the eastern part of
Hyrule Field at the 2:00 position on the clock

-------------
Zora's River

Return to the Bean Man and buy out the rest of his beans.  Go all the way to
the eastern edge of the river, near to the entrance of Zora's Domain.  On the
way, stop off at the Musical Frogs and play them the Song of Time to make back
fifty rupees.

Once you reach the entrance to Zora's Domain, look to the right of the
waterfall, where there is a deep pool of water.  Swim to it's bottom, and enter
the tunnel at the bottom to warp to Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods

Get out of the pool, and go right through the log tunnel, then take a left
through another log on the other side.  Defeat the Business Scrub on the right
as you leave the tunnel, then make him leave by refusing his wares.  Drop a
Bottled Bug into the patch of soft earth to reveal a Gold Skulltula (if you
didn't get it last time you were here), and remember to recapture one of the
three bugs that appears.  Plant one of the Magic Beans, then head for the large
tree in the back of the clearing.  In the grass, there is a cluster of
butterflies.  The butterflies are actually hovering over an invisible hole.
Drop down into this hole to enter the Forest Stage.

-------------
Forest Stage
New Upgrade: Deku Nuts x40

Put on the Mask of Truth, then step forward.  The Deku Scrubs down here will
stare at you.  Go and speak to their Chief (the Scrub with the "mustache") on
the right side of the  room, and he will increase the number of Deku Nuts you
can carry.  Enter the beam of light to return to the Lost Woods.

-----------
Lost Woods

Run forward through the log tunnel, and go right at the crossroads on the other
side.  Go right again at the pool of water, and left at the stone arch.  Turn
right again at the next crossroads, and go straight at the next.  Enter the
tunnel in the southwest corner of the next area.  Drop a Bottled Bug into the
patch of soft earth to get the Gold Skulltula (if you didn't get it last time),
and remember to recapture one of the bugs who comes out.  Plant one of your
Magic Beans in the patch.  If you still haven't bought the Deku Stick Upgrade
from the Business Scrub in the rear of this valley, then do so now.

Turn around, and go back through the log tunnel.  Hang a right and go through
the next log tunnel, then go to the right to enter Kokiri Forest.

--------------
Kokiri Forest
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS043]

Jump down to the bottom level of Kokiri Forest and head for the shop on the
east end.  Look for patch of soft earth behind the shop.  Drop a bug in it
(remember to recapture one), and kill the Gold Skulltula that appears.  Take
it's token, then plant the Magic Beans.  You're done planting Beans for a while
- if you bought all of them from the Bean Man, then you should have two left.
It will be a very long time before you get rid of both of them.

Head for the Deku Tree in the east side of the area, and enter the dungeon.
It's time for one last Gold Skulltula.

---------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - The Trunk

If you like, use Farore's Wind at the start of the dungeon so that you can warp
right back to the start as soon as you have claimed the Gold Skulltula.

Drop down the hole in the middle of the first floor to reach the sub-basement.
Climb up onto the stone block on the north side of the room, jump onto the
upper ledge, and crawl through the tunnel on the west side.

----------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Small Nest

Run around the room in a wide circle to attract the attention of the Gohma
Larva hanging on the ceiling.  Kill the Larva, then light a Deku Stick on the
torch and use it to burn through the webbing in the northwest part of the room.
Kill the Deku Baba on the other side, then bomb the sealed wall.  Open the door
on the other side.

-----------------------------------
Inside the Deku Tree - Hidden Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS044]

Kill the Big Skulltula against the wall, then turn around and face the door.
On the right of the door is a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token
using the Boomerang, then leave the dungeon and return to the Hyrule Castle
Market.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market

Go to the Temple of Time.  It's to the right of the Happy Mask Shop.

----------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Temple of Time Exterior

Go around the path and enter the Temple of Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time
New Equipment: Master Sword

You'll find another one of those strange platforms here.  Run forward to the
black obelisk pedestal with the red carpeting in front of the Door of Time.
Stand on the red carpeting, take out the Ocarina of Time and play the Song of
Time.

The three Spiritual Stones, together with the Ocarina of Time and the Song of
Time, will open the Door of Time.  The Triforce above the door will glow, and
the gateway to the Sacred Realm will be open.

Run through the door, where you will find a pedestal which contains a Sword in
a Stone.  This is, of course, the Master Sword.  Draw the Master Sword from
it's pedestal.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)

-------------------
The Temple of Time
New Quest Item: The Light Medallion

You've been tricked.  Ganondorf, suspecting that you held the Spiritual Stones
and the Ocarina of Time, followed you through the door to the Sacred Realm.
When you pulled the Master Sword from it's pedestal, you were not yet ready for
it's power.  The Sword placed you in a magical form of sleep for seven years,
and in that time Ganondorf took the Triforce of Power (one of the fragments of
the Triforce) for his own, and took control of Hyrule.  The other two fragments
are missing.

When you awake, you will meet Rauru, the only awakened Sage.  To defeat
Ganondorf, the other five Sages must be found and awakened in their respective
Temples.  Rauru will give you the Light Medallion, a symbol of his power, and
transport you back to the Temple of Time.  Just to clarify, awakening Sages
doesn't make you any more powerful.  It's just a storyline element.

Once back at the Temple of Time, you will meet Sheik, the last of Impa's tribe
of warriors.  Sheik will act as a guide, of sorts, as you progress through the
Temples, and has a very important role in the game's climax.  You probably
already know what it is, but I won't mention it on the rare off chance that you
don't.  Sheik will send you off to the first temple, The Forest Temple, and
gives the cryptic hint that the Sage is someone you know (as it turns out, all
of the Sages are people you meet as a Child, but that was probably fairly
obvious from the beginning).  Sheik also advises you that, before you run off
to the Forest Temple, you head for Kakariko Village, where you will find an
item of great value.

After you're finally released from this long bit of prose, head back out the
Door of Time and return to The Temple of Time Exterior.

------------------------------
The Temple of Time - Exterior

After you're done goggling at Death Mountain's pretty new hood ornament, head
east then south to the former Hyrule Castle Market.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market

Hyrule Castle Market is now filled with Redeads.  This is actually a good thing
- Redeads drop lots of Magic Pots, and this square is so full of them that
refilling your Magic Pots is three easy kills away.  Return to the Hyrule
Castle Drawbridge.

---------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Drawbridge

If you want, you can enter the former Gatehouse to find a new Poe Shop, where
the shopkeeper will buy your captured Poes and Big Poes.  The most important
function of the Poe Shop is it is the place where you acquire the game's fourth
and final bottle.  We'll get to that after the Forest Temple, when we have all
of the required equipment.  Head northeast and through the drawbridge, which is
now shattered and remains open day or night.

-------------
Hyrule Field

There's still a bit to do before we head for the Forest Temple.  The first
order of business is to get your hands on a horse.  Head north to Lon Lon
Ranch.

--------------
Lon Lon Ranch
New Upgrade: Epona

Run forward and through the arch into the field.  Ingo is standing next to the
now fenced-off paddock.  If you've been following my guide to the letter, then
we haven't met Ingo yet, but he's the thin guy in the ruff.  Speak with Ingo.
He'll rant about what a victim he is, and how great Ganondorf is.  He'll then
offer to let you ride one of the horses.  Pay him 10 rupees, and when you enter
the paddock, ignore the horse that Ingo offers you.  Play Epona's Song, and the
now fully-grown Epona will run towards you.  Aim Epona at one of the fences in
the course, then begin tapping A to feed her carrots and move forward.  Jump
over both of the fences in the course to make back your ten rupees, then speak
with Ingo.

Tell Ingo that you want to quit riding.  Once you are back outside the paddock,
speak with Ingo again and tell him that you want to ride again.  Get on Epona
again, then ride over both fences again to make back your money.  Now, speak
with Ingo WHILE you are riding Epona (z-target him to make it easier), and Ingo
will challenge you to a race for 50 rupees.  Accept the challenge.

Defeat Ingo by getting in front of him, and carefully steering Epona so that
you stay in front of his path.  Alternatively, you can also use a steady amount
of carrots and hug the inside the rail.  Use your first four carrots quickly,
then wait for one to regenerate, then use another carrot, then wait for it to
regenerate, then use another, etc. etc.

Defeat Ingo, and he'll challenge you to another race.  And this time, if you
win, he'll let you keep Epona.  Agree.  On this race, Ingo will cheat, and
start a second before the clock says Go.  Because you're the good guy, you
don't get this luxury.  Repeat the same strategy you used to beat him last
time; hug the inside rail, and use a steady amount of carrots, or get in front
of him and keep him from progressing.  The only thing harder about this race is
Ingo cheats.  He tends to take the corners very wide, so that's your
opportunity to move in front of him.

Once you defeat Ingo for the second time, he'll honor his bet, but he'll also
prevent you from leaving the Ranch by closing the gate.  To make it over the
gate, you must run around the path around the paddock in a counter-clockwise
pattern.  Once you come around the corner and see the gate, burn all of your
carrots at once and charge straight at the gate.  It can take a few tries
before you can coax Epona over; this is as much about luck as it is about aim.
Once you make it over the gate, then you will return to Hyrule Field and Epona
will become yours.

If you want to have some fun, you can also trample on the Cuccos in the
northeast corner of the pasture, and a flock of Cuccos will appear and begin to
attack you.  But because you're on Epona, they can't hurt you.

-------------
Hyrule Field

Now that you have Epona, you can spot the Big Poes that appear around Hyrule
Field.  You can't actually kill them until you get the Fairy Bow from the
Forest Temple, however.  Head for Kakariko Village in the northeast corner of
the Field.  Come to a complete stop and press A to get off Epona.  Enter
Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Head for Kakariko Graveyard in the east side of the map.  Notice that the
unfinished building is now finished; it contains the new Shooting Gallery.
We'll return here once we get the Fairy Bow for the first Bow Upgrade.

-------------------
Kakariko Graveyard
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP18]

Head for the left side of the graveyard.  Remember where we planted one of the
Magic Beans as Young Link?  A Magic Leaf has now appeared there.  Step onto the
Leaf to ride up to a high cliff, which contains a crate.  Roll into the crate
to find a Piece of Heart.  Right next to the Magic Leaf, there is a gravestone
with flowers on it.  Grab this gravestone from behind and pull it away to
reveal a pit.  Drop down into the pit.

-------------------------------
Dampe's Amazing Cave Race Game
New Item: Hookshot

Step forward a few feet to find the ghost of Dampe.  He will challenge you to a
race, and will start without notice.  Immediately run forward, dodging the
flames that Dampe drops (he'll drop them the entire race - keep an eye out for
them).  Turn right at the halls end, taking the corner tight to dodge a flame.
Turn left at the next corner, taking the turn wide to dodge another flame.

Run forward between the pair of flames, running along the left side of the gap.
Turn left and then right immediately on the other side, taking the turn wide to
dodge another flame.  Turn right, then left, then left again, taking the turn
tight.  Take another tight turn on the other side, and go through the door.

Take a right on the other side, and another right, and then a wide left.  Run
along the left or right side of the tunnel, then enter the wide room.  Go
through the door on the right.  Take a left, then a wide right, then through
another door.  Run to the wall on the other side, then a right, then a tight
left.

Jump onto the ledge to your left, and hug the left wall as you run forward to
dodge more flames.  Take a wide left, then a tight left to enter a tall room
with a large pit in the middle.  Run along the path around the perimeter of the
room and through the door at the top.

Speak with Dampe in this room, and he will give you the Hookshot.  This has the
functionality of Young Link's Boomerang, and also let's you latch onto certain
objects and pull yourself towards them.  Run straight forward and through the
door.

Once the door from the Cave Race closes, you are locked in this tiny space with
two blue blocks.  Play the Song of Time to make them disappear, then climb up
the staircase on the other side to find yourself back in the Windmill.

----------------------------
Kakariko Village - Windmill
New Song: The Song of Storms

If you didn't get the Piece of Heart from the Windmill as Young Link, then
you'll get it now at the top of the staircase.  Drop down onto the main floor,
and then stand in front of the Organ Grinder in the Windmill.  Take out your
Ocarina of Time, and he'll teach you the Song of Storms.  Among other uses, the
Song of Storms lets you access the Bottom of the Well dungeon a little later in
the game.  Leave back out the door.

-----------------
Kakariko Village
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP19]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS045]

Now that you have Epona and the Hookshot, you can do the first few parts of the
quest string for the Biggoron Sword.  In fact, you can do the whole thing right
away if you like, but I'll direct you to which parts to do and when throughout
the rest of the guide as it is convenient.  In case you don't know, the
Biggoron Sword is the single most powerful weapon in the game, but also removes
the ability to use your Shield.  If you would like to start on the Biggoron
Sword quest, then go the appropriate Subchapter and do Part I.  If you do
choose to do the entire Trading Sequence in one go, then I advise you to ignore
any Heart Pieces or Gold Skulltulas you find along the way in order to avoid
confusion later.

Jump onto the fence in front of the Windmill door, and look to the right to see
a tall building with a blue roof.  Use the Hookshot to latch onto the blue roof
(you should see a red targeting reticule on the roof).  You may need to adjust
your aim slightly by moving to the left or right as needed.  Once you are on
the roof, speak with the man gazing up at Death Mountain to get another Piece
of Heart.

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime.  At this point, you can head into the
House of Skulltula to get the 40 Skulltula Token reward if you like (it's just
some lousy Bombchus, so it's no big deal if you skip it).  Climb up to the
entrance to Impa's House (the large house at the southern edge of town), and
use the Hookshot to get onto the roof of House of Skulltula.  Once there, use
the Hookshot again to reach the roof of Impa's House.  Head to the southern
wall of Impa's House, and kill the Gold Skulltula on the wall.  Take it's
token.

Now, head back to Hyrule Castle Market.

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market

Go through the passage at the north end of town, which formerly lead to the
Hyrule Castle Garden as Young Link.

---------------------------
Ganon's Castle (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS046]

Make sure it's nighttime, then head forward and around the corner.  Run under
the stone archway, and turn around on the other side.  On the right side of the
archway, suspended over the lava, there is a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take
it's token with the Hookshot.  Return to Hyrule Field.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)

-------------
Hyrule Field

It's time to move on with the journey.  Head for the Kokiri Forest.

--------------------------
Kokiri Forest (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS047]

The Kokiri Forest is now populated by Mad Scrubs, Octoroks and massive Deku
Babas.  Change it to nighttime if you need to, then head for the east side of
the forest to the Kokiri Twin's house.  It's the house on the south side of the
pond with the twin branches coming out of it's top.  Kill the Gold Skulltula on
the back of the tree and take it's token with the Hookshot.

If you planted the Magic Bean behind the Shop as Young Link, then you can now
ride the Magic Leaf on a scenic tour around the forest, finally ending near a
hidden alcove full of Rupees.  Once you have the Rupees, head for the Lost
Woods via the entrance behind Mido's House (the tree house closest to the west
entrance of Kokiri Forest).

-----------------------
Lost Woods (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS048]

If you're doing the Biggoron Sword Trading Sequence, then you should now do
Part II through V in the appropriate Subchapter.  If you've already done the
whole thing, or if you're not doing it at all, then continue on with the guide
from this point.

Make sure it's nighttime before your progress very far into the Lost Woods.

You're now going to have navigate the Lost Woods without the aid of Saria's
music to guide you.  You can either try it from memory, trial-by-error, or you
can just follow my directions.  Go right from the entrance to Kokiri Forest,
and then left on the other side (if you want, you can jump down into the valley
where the twin Skull Kids who played the Ocarina game with Young Link, who will
now attempt to kill you).  At the stone arch, go right to find yourself at the
Pond.  A still-childlike Mido will block your path to the left.  Play him
Saria's Song, and he'll let you pass.

At the crossroads after Mido, go left to find yourself back in the Forest Stage
clearing.  If you planted the Magic Beans here as a Child, then there will be a
Magic Leaf on the right side of the clearing.  Ride the Magic Leaf up to the
cliff above the clearing, where you will find a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and
take it's token, then return to the previous crossroads.

Go left (straight if you're coming from the Pool), and left again on the other
side.  Take a right at the next crossroads to reach the Sacred Forest Meadow.

-------------------------------------
The Sacred Forest Meadow (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS049]
New Song: The Minuet of Forest

Run forward to the entrance to the maze-like area which you navigated as Young
Link.  The Mad Scrubs are gone, replaced by Moriblins.  Moriblins are huge
goblin-like creatures who patrol the passages in the Sacred Forest Meadow.  If
you pass into the sight of one, then he will charge you down and push you into
the pools of water at the end of each passage.  To defeat the Moriblins, wait
for them to face away from you and shoot them in the back with the Hookshot.

At the first passage in the maze, use the Z-Button to adjust the camera's view
so you can see the Moriblin around the corner.  Wait for it to face away from
you, and jump out and quickly nail it in the back with the Hookshot.  Move
slowly, otherwise the Moriblin will hear you and charge you down.  Once it is
dead, go to the right and around the corner.  Wait for the Moriblin in this
passage to face away from you, then kill it with the Hookshot as well.

Run to the end of this passage, and go right at the end.  Peek around the next
corner, and nail the Moriblin here when the opportunity arises.  Run down this
passage, and turn left at the flowery passage.  Peek around this corner, and
kill the Moriblin as it passes by you.  Go right, and left at the end of the
passage and into the pool of water.  Climb up out of the pool, and climb up the
ladder on the left (if you see a Moriblin here, then wait for him to turn away
before climbing out of the pool).  At the top of the ladder, go to the left a
short ways to find a Gold Skulltula.  In the center of the maze, there is a pit
which contains a handy Fairy Fountain.  This Fountain is extremely useful
during the following dungeon if you're still new to the game, and is also one
of the most easily accessible Fairy Fountains in the game once you get the
Minuet of Forest.

Turn around and go back down the ladder you just climbed up.  Go up the
stairset opposite the ladder, and at the top you'll see a Monblin.  The Monblin
will attack you by sending shockwaves down the long passage.  Dodge the
shockwaves by running to the left and right between each shockwave, and running
around behind the Monblin when you reach him.  Kill the Monblin by performing
two Jump Attacks against his backside, whereupon he will drop a large number of
Rupees.

Once the Monblin is dead, go up the stairset behind him and step onto the large
pedestal inscribed with the Triforce, where a cutscene will introduce you to
Sheik once more.  Sheik will teach you the Minuet of Forest, which will
transport you to this location every time you play the song.

After Sheik departs, use the Hookshot on the large tree branch which hangs
above the shattered stairset.  Once you're at the top of the stairs, go through
the doorway to enter Adult Link's first dungeon.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)

Significant in that it contains the game's first hard and complex puzzles, as
well as the first truly deadly boss, and finally that it introduces Keys, the
Forest Temple is a big step up from the previous three dungeons in the game.
Near the beginning of the dungeon, four Poe Sisters steal flames from a large
altar, which causes an elevator in the middle of the altar to retract.  The
main goal in the dungeon is tracking down and killing the Poe Sisters, and
reclaiming their flames to reactivate the elevator.  The dungeon actually forms
one giant loop around this central chamber, though it is difficult to tell in
the dungeon's unique architecture.

-----------------------------
The Forest Temple - Entrance
New Dungeon Item: Small Key
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS050]

If you got the Biggoron Sword, then I strongly recommend that you stick with
the Master Sword and Hylian Shield for the majority of the dungeon.  The
Biggoron Sword is an excellent choice against any Boss in the game, however,
particularly the Forest Temple's boss.

Run forward a short ways, and dispatch the pair of Gray Wolfos enemies who
greet you.  Defeat them the same way you defeated the Gray Wolfos you
encountered as a child: wait for them to attack, then backflip out of range,
and immediately execute a Jump Attack while their back is turned.  Once they
are dead, look to the right and climb up the ivy wall to the tops of the pair
of trees in the courtyard.

Once you are at the top of the tree, look to the top-right of the ivy wall to
find a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token with the Hookshot, then
turn around.  Edge along to the edge of the tree branch, then jump to the tree
branch adjacent to it.  Edge along this tree branch to the end, and open the
chest to find a Small Key.  Adult Link now has to find Keys to progress in the
dungeons, which include Small Keys that open regular locked doors, as well as
the Boss Key which opens the final locked door in the dungeon, that leads to
the boss.  Drop back down to the bottom floor, and go through the door beneath
the stone archway.

----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - South Passage

This room contains a Big Skulltula.  As Young Link, you had to wait for them to
turn away from you before you could damage them.  Now, a single shot from the
Hookshot to any part of the Big Skulltula will kill it instantly.  Dispatch the
Big Skulltula, then go through the door on the other end of the hall.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - The Torch Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS051]

Run forward into the rooms a short ways, and the four Poe Sisters will appear
and steal the four flames from the torches in the center of the room.  This
will cause the elevator in the center of the room to lower.  Which is
unfortunate, because we need to get down that elevator.  Most of the dungeon is
spent recovering these four flames to reach the boss.

Run straight across the room to the opposite end, where you should jump up onto
the ledge and go up the stairs.  At the top of the stairs, look to the right to
spot a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token with the Hookshot, then go
through the door at the top of the stairs.

----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - North Passage

This room contains a Blue Bubble.  Defeat it by holding up your Shield while Z-
Targeting it, and let it touch you.  This will cause the blue flame around it
to vanish, at which point it will become vulnerable.  Alternatively, you can
also stun it with the Hookshot, but the Blue Bubble's speed and the Hookshot's
slowness can make this strategy problematic.

After the Blue Bubble is dead, go through the door at the other end of the
hall.

------------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Lower Stalfos Chamber
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

This room contains two Stalfos, giant skeletons who become a common sight later
in the game.  The Stalfos are slightly chivalrous, and will not attack you if
you have one of them Z-Targeted.  So Z-Target one of them as quick as you can.
Move actively around the room by circling the Stalfos, and keep your Shield
raised for extra defense.  Stalfos can block most of your attacks, but just
like Wolfos they are briefly vulnerable immediately after they attack.  This is
especially true after they perform their Jump Attack.  Attack them from the
side or from behind immediately after they attack to dispatch them easily.

Once both of the Stalfos are dead, a chest will appear in the center of the
room.  Open it to get a Small Key.  Smash both of the pots in the rear of the
room to find a Recovery Heart and a Fairy, then return to the Torch Room (the
room where the Poe Sisters stole the flames).

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - The Torch Room

Run down the stairs and go to the right at the bottom, where there is a small
hallway with a blue block at the end.  Stand near the block and play the Song
of Time with the Ocarina of Time to remove the block, revealing a door.  Go
through the door.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Courtyard

Kill the Big Deku Baba directly in front of you as you enter, as well as the
Octorok in the stream of water to the left.  Go to the right side of the
courtyard, where you will find an ivy wall.  Use the Hookshot to kill the first
two Skullwalltulas on the Ivy Wall, but the third is just slightly out of your
reach.  Climb the Ivy Wall, sticking as far to the right as possible to avoid
the Skullwalltula.  Enter the alcove at the top of the ivy wall and go through
the door inside.

------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Balcony Hallway
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

Kill the Blue Bubble, and the door on the other end of the hall will open, and
a chest will appear.  Open the chest to get the Dungeon Map.  Go through the
door you just opened.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - East Courtyard
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula x1 [GS052]

Kill the Deku Baba directly in front of you as you enter, and look to the left
to see a Skullwalltula on an ivy wall.  Use the Hookshot to kill it.  Look to
the left to see another balcony with a small white circle above it.  Shoot this
circle with the Hookshot to pull yourself over to that balcony.  Step on the
switch on this balcony, and the well in the corner of the Courtyard will drain.

Jump off the balcony to the ground far below.  Kill the Octorok in the pool of
water and the Big Deku Baba, then look to the large cliff out in the middle of
the pool.  It has a chest on top of it.  If you stand on the right side of the
dirt path where it dead-ends at the pool, you can use your Hookshot to latch
onto the chest.  Get up to the chest to find... a Recovery Heart.  Exciting.
The real prize is the Gold Skulltula, which is found clinging to the wall
around the corner from the chest.

After you have the token, jump back off the cliff and head to the right side of
the Courtyard.  Jump into the well and land at it's bottom.

-----------------------------
The Forest Temple - The Well
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run to the end of the passage, grabbing the recovery hearts along the way.
Open the chest at the end of the passage to find a Small Key.  Climb up the Ivy
Wall to it's top to find yourself back in the West Courtyard.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Courtyard

Return to the Torch Room through the door under the stone arch.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - The Torch Room

Run down the hall towards the center of the room, and climb up on the ledge to
the right as you come out of the West Courtyard door.  Go up the stairs and use
one of your Small Keys to open the door.

---------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Passage

Defeat the Big Skulltula with the Hookshot, and go through the door at the
other end of the hall.

-------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Stone Block Room

Defeat the Blue Bubble, then run forward and climb up the ladder.  Climb up the
next ladder on the right, then go left around the corner and left again through
the doorway.  If you look to the left as you enter this room, you'll see a
massive stone block, with arrows painted on the floor.  You must push the stone
block along these arrows.

Run forward through the doorway in front of you, then take a left and down the
hall through another doorway.  Go left once more, and left again through yet
another doorway.  You are now on the other side of that gigantic stone block.
Push it forward, and you will see a ladder appear on the right.  Ignore it for
now.  Keep pushing the block forward, until a passage appears on the left which
is large enough for you to slip through.  Run around behind the stone block,
and push it back until the gap you just passed through is closed again.

Move around to the side of the stone block, and push the block forward until it
stops.  Turn around, and go back down the passage you just pushed the block
down.  Go back around the ledge, taking three rights, to find yourself back on
the other side of the stone block.  Push it forward once more until it falls
into a small alcove.  You can now jump up to the third level by climbing onto
the stone block.

It is now time to climb that ladder that we ignored earlier, which will take
you back up to the third level.  Climb up the ladder, turn to the right at the
top of the ladder, and right again through the doorway.  Push the stone block
directly in front of you forward until it stops, then drop back down to the
second level via the ladder.

Back on the second level, run to the stone block that you pushed into place
earlier, and climb on top of it to reach the second level.  Run down the
passage at the top to reach the stone block on the third level, and push it
forward until it falls into another small pit in the floor, letting you reach
the top level of this room.  Climb up to the top level.

Go right after climbing up two ledges, and then up the ladder around the next
corner.  Go right around the next corner, and either kill or dodge the two Blue
Bubbles before going through the door at the other end of the room.

-----------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Twisted Hallway

Run to the end of the hall, and in the large room on the other side Navi will
warn you to watch for the shadows of enemies who hang from the ceiling.  This
is actually a warning about Wallmasters, enemies who appear periodically
throughout the game.  If they manage to land on you, then they will drag you
back to the entrance of the Dungeon.  Which is bad times.  If you see the
shadow of a Wall Master coming down on you, then quickly begin running in very
large circles to avoid it, and then kill it with your Sword when it lands.
Alternatively, if you don't or can't kill the Wall Master, you can also enter
First Person Mode, and the creature will temporarily disappear.

Kill or ignore the Wallmaster, and then jump out to the stone pillar directly
in front of you, then jump to the right from there.  Enter the door.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Stairwell

This room is a large series of stairs, with walls that are dotted with three
portraits.  Images of one of the Poe Sisters appears in each of these
portraits.  We'll be dealing with her in a moment.  For now, run to the bottom
of the pair of stairsets and through the door at the bottom of the second.

---------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Upper Stalfos Room
New Item: Bow and Arrow

Run into the room, watching out for the large pit in the center which drops
back down to the Lower Stalfos Room.  A Stalfos will appear, one who has the
magical ability to walk over the pit as though it weren't there.  Don't be
fooled; you do not share this power.  Defeat the Stalfos, and an elevator will
drop down from above, covering the pit.  This elevator carries two more
Stalfos.  You must defeat both of them quickly; if you take too long on the
second one after defeating the first one, then they will both regenerate.
Defeat both of them, and a Chest will appear which contains the Bow and Arrows.
Take it, then return to the West Stairwell.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Stairwell
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

You'll know if this is the West Stairwell, since the stairs will be on the left
side and the Poe Sister will be colored red.  If the stairs are on the right
and the Poe Sister is colored blue, then you're in the wrong stairwell.  Return
to the Upper Stalfos Room and use the other door.

You must now shoot the portrait which contains the Poe Sister using the Bow and
Arrow.  If you get too close, then the Poe Sister will vanish, and move to
another painting.  So you want to shoot the portrait from as far away as
possible.  Standing at the bottom or top of the stairwell is your best bet.
Once you shoot out the picture containing the Poe, then the portrait will burn
into ashes, and the Poe will move to another picture.  Destroy all three
pictures in the stairwell, and the Poe Sister will appear at the bottom of the
stairwell.

Go down the stairs and shoot her with an Arrow, whereupon she will disappear.
Wait for her to appear again, then shoot her with another Arrow.  Repeat until
she dies.  If you attempt to Z-Target her, then she will vanish.  So don't even
attempt to Z-Target her.  If you draw too close to her, visible or invisible,
then she will perform a spinning attack with her torch.  Once she is dead, then
her Flame will return to the torch in this room, as well as to the torch back
in the Torch Room, and a chest will appear.  Open it to get a Small Key.  Climb
back to the top floor of the stairwell, and go back to the West Twisted
Hallway.  From there, return to the Stone Block Room.

-------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Stone Block Room

Turn around as you come into the room, and look above the door to see a silver
eye.  Shoot the eye with your Bow and Arrow.  The Twisted Hallway on the other
side of the door will straighten itself out.  Go back through the door.

-----------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Twisted Hallway
New Dungeon Item: Boss Key

Run down the now-straightened hall, and drop down into the room.  You are now
standing on what was formerly the wall the last time you were here.  Watch out
for Wallmasters while you're here.  Open the blue chest to get the Boss Key,
which will let you open the door to the Boss' chamber.  Once you have the Boss
Key, drop through the pit in the floor.

Kill both of the Blue Bubbles in this room to open the door in the south of the
area.  Go through the door.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Courtyard
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS053]

You're now on an upper ledge in the West Courtyard.  Be careful not to fall
off, unless running all the way back around the dungeon sounds like fun to you.
Run along the ledge, killing the Big Deku Baba on the way.  Look to the right
from the Deku Baba, where you will see a broken column which makes a makeshift
platform.  It also has two Recovery Hearts.  Jump out to these Recovery Hearts
and walk slowly to the far edge of the broken columns, and look up to find a
Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token with the Hookshot, then jump back
to the ledge with the (dead) Deku Baba.  There are a number of alcoves on the
right as you go along the ledge.  Go into the alcove on the far end of the
ledge to find a door.  Go through it.

-------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Floormaster Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

This room contains a Floormaster, which is similar to the Wallmaster, except it
cannot grab you and drag you back to the dungeon's entrance.  It instead
employs a charging attack, which is a more traditional attack then the
Wallmaster.  If the Floormaster glows green, it becomes invulnerable and is
about to attack.  Give it plenty of space when this happens.  Attack the
Floormaster when it is not glowing, and when it dies it will split into three
smaller Floormasters.  Kill these midgets quickly using the Bow and Arrow,
otherwise they will quickly grow into full-sized Floormasters.

After the Floormaster is dead, a chest will appear in the room.  Open it to get
a Small Key.  Return to the previous room.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - West Courtyard

Back on the ledge, turn to the right and go through the door.

-------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Stone Block Room

Jump down to the bottom level of the Stone Block Room, and kill the Blue
Bubble.  Climb your way all the way back up to the top of the room.  If you
like, you can stop on the third level to shoot a golden eye with an arrow,
which will give you a chest with a bundle of arrows.  If you missed the Boss
Key in the West Twisted Hallway, then go through the door again to claim it.
Otherwise, shoot the silver eye above the doorway to re-twist the hallway.
Once the hallway is properly screwed up again, go through the door and return
to the West Stairwell, and back to the Upper Stalfos Room.

---------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Upper Stalfos Room

Go through the opposite door.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - East Stairwell
New Dungeon Item: Compass

Repeat the portrait-shooting process from the West Stairwell.  Once all three
portraits are destroyed, then the Poe Sister will appear at the bottom of the
stairwell.  Defeat her the same way you defeated the previous one.  Once she is
dead, a chest will appear.  Open it to get the Compass.  Climb back to the top
of the stairwell, and go through the locked door.

-----------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - East Twisted Hallway

Step forward into the room, and Navi will once again inform you of the presence
of Wallmasters.  Ain't she the most annoying?  I mean, greatest?

Drop down to the floor and wait for the Wallmaster to appear.  Dodge it and
kill it.  You don't want it interfering with you while you're trying to work in
this room.  To the right from the door where you entered the room is a tall
ladder with a doorway at the top.  Go down the hallway inside, where you will
encounter two Green Bubbles.

Green Bubbles are identical to Blue Bubbles, only they do not aggressively
attack and their flame shield randomly toggles on and off.  You can also
disable their shield by walking into them with your shield up.  Shoot the Green
Bubbles with Arrows when their Green Flame turns off, or ignore them.  Enter
the door at the end of the hall.

-------------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - The Flaming Arrow Room

This room contains four rotating platforms, which move in orbit around a torch
in the center of the room.  Against the right wall as you enter is an eyeball
switch, which is frozen over by a chunk of ice.  To shoot the switch, you must
ride on the rotating platforms, and shoot an arrow through the flame, and onto
the eyeball switch.  The flaming arrow will melt the ice and activate the
switch.  Once the eyeball switch is activated, then the previous room will
twist itself up.  Return to the previous room.

-----------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - East Twisted Hallway

Run down to the end of the now-twisted hallway, and drop down to the floor on
the other end of the hall.  Run around waiting for the Wallmaster, and kill it
when it lands.  Drop down the pit in the corner, to the right as you jump down
from the hallway.

------------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Crushing Ceiling Room

Face south as you land, and you'll see a ceiling with lots of gaps in it.  It
probably won't surprise you to hear, but this ceiling will fall down if you
step too near it.  Run forward, and stop when Navi bugs you.  Wait for the
ceiling to crash down, so you can see where the next gap is.  Keep running
south down the room, stopping at each gap to spy the next gap and kill any Big
Skulltulas with arrows as needed.  Halfway down the hall on the right is a
switch.  Step on this switch to open the door at the end of the hall.  Go
through this door.

--------------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Puzzle Block Room

Shoot the portrait of the Poe Sister on the wall with an arrow, and the puzzle
blocks hanging above will come down.  Four of the blocks can be pushed together
to form a picture of the yellow Poe Sister.  The fifth is superfluous.  Find
the block which doesn't match (the color should be fairly easy to distinguish),
and push it out of the way before pushing the other blocks together to make the
Poe Sister appear.  Kill her the same way you defeated the other two.

Once the Green Flame is back in place, climb up the ledge near the torch and go
through the door.

---------------------------------
The Forest Temple - East Hallway

Kill the Big Skulltula on the ceiling, and go through the door at the other end
of the hall.

-----------------------------------
The Forest Temple - The Torch Room

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Amy Poe

Jump off the balcony and into the middle of the room to meet the final Poe
Sister, Amy.  Amy is very different from her sisters.  She will split into four
different versions.  One is the real Amy, the other three are fakes.  There are
two different methods to finding the real Amy.  The first, is to randomly shoot
the different Poes until you hit the real Amy.  The second, is just to pay
attention.  The real Amy does a little spin when she first splits up.  Shoot
this Amy with an arrow, and she will split into four new Amys.  Wait for the
real Amy to spin, and shoot her again.  Amy doesn't really attack unless you
give her the opportunity by taking too long to shoot the real Amy.  Just stand
still in the middle of the room while the four Amys dance around you, and shoot
when you get the chance.  It's okay to Z-Target Amy; she doesn't disappear like
her sisters.

Once Amy dies, then the last flame will come into place, and the elevator in
the floor will rise up.  Go down this elevator.

---------------------------------
The Forest Temple - Spinner Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS054]

This room contains a large number of rooms, most of which are blocked off by
the wall.  The wall can be pushed into new positions by grabbing a hold of one
of the two pieces of the wall that jut out on the right and left.

As soon as you enter the room, go to the left and grab hold of the north side
of the handle.  Push it towards the south.  Head for the northwest corner of
the room, where there is a small room with a switch inside it.  Step onto the
switch, and a door will open elsewhere in the room.

As you come out of the room, go to the handle on the right.  Stand on the north
side of the handle, and push it to the south.  Go to the east side of the room,
and enter the small alcove to step onto another switch.  Another gate will open
elsewhere in the room.  Turn around and go back out into the room.

Go to the right and to the eastern side of the handle, and push it to the west.
Go to the southwest and into the small room.  Kill the Big Skulltula and open
the chest to find a bundle of arrows.  Turn around, and look on the wall to the
left.  Kill the Gold Skulltula and take it's token with the Hookshot.  Return
to the main room.

Go to the right as you come out of the small alcove, and go to the south side
of the handle.  Push it north.  Go to the south of the room, and step on the
switch.  The grating covering the doorway on the north side of the room will
now open.  Go to the north side of the room and through the doorway.  Enter the
door on the other side.

New Quest Item: Forest Medallion

Go to the right and up the stairs.  Run into the middle of the large stage, and
then turn around and try to leave the way you came in.  Spears will erupt from
the floor trapping you on the stage, and Phantom Ganon will appear.

At the start of the fight, Phantom Ganon will be mounted on a flying horse, and
will retreat into one of the paintings that encircle the room.  He will then
appear in two of the paintings, charging towards you down the path; one of them
is the real Phantom Ganon, the other is fake.  The fake one will turn back at
the last minute, the real one will emerge from the painting and scatter the
field with electricity.  To damage Phantom Ganon in this phase, you must shoot
him with an arrow as he emerges from the painting.  The real Phantom Ganon will
make the painting slightly brighter.  Even if you mess up and choose the fake
Ganon, then there is still enough time to change targets.

After you have shot Phantom Ganon three times in his first phase, then he will
enter his second phase.  If you have the Biggoron Sword, then switch to it now.
The Shield is worthless in this phase, and the Biggoron Sword's wider reach is
a significant advantage in this next part.

Phantom Ganon will now begin throwing balls of lightning at you.  To damage him
now, you must stun him by reflecting these lightning balls back at him using
sword strikes (if you're feeling silly, you can also use Bottles).  The ball
moves faster with each successive hit.  If you're feeling reckless, then you
can stand closer to Phantom Ganon.  This makes it harder to reflect shots, but
can get the fight over faster if you're good.  Conversely, you can stand on the
opposite end of the field to reflect the shots.  This is easier, and
recommended for newer or uncoordinated players.

Once the ball strikes Phantom Ganon, then he will be stunned briefly and fall
to the ground.  At this point, you should run in and begin pummeling him to
death with the Biggoron Sword (or Master Sword if you don't have the Biggoron
Sword yet).  Only do one Jump Attack, then proceed to regular strikes.  Doing
repeated Jump Attacks takes too long, and the close range may make several of
them miss.  Once Phantom Ganon recovers from the stun, then he returns to
throwing balls of lightning at you.  Repeat reflecting and attacking Phantom
Ganon until he is defeated.

After he dies, take the Heart Container that appears and enter the beam of
light.  You will be transported to the Chamber of the Sages, where you will
meet the Sage of the Forest... Saria.  After Saria gives you her power in the
form of the Forest Medallion, you will be transported back outside to the
Kokiri Forest, where a new Deku Tree will sprout.  The Deku Sprout will reveal
what was rather obvious all along: Link is not a Kokiri, but a Hylian.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

--------------
Kokiri Forest

This chapter title is misleading.  We're actually going to a number of places
before we even go anywhere near Death Mountain.  SO SUE ME.  For starters,
return to Hyrule Field and go to Lake Hylia.

-----------
Lake Hylia
New Song: Scarecrow's Song

If you remember, the last time you were here as Young Link, then you invented a
song and played it for the Scarecrow on the northeastern shore of the Lake.
Return to this Scarecrow now, and play the song for him again.  This song will
now become the Scarecrow's Song, which will summon Pierre the Scarecrow to
various points throughout the game.  This skill will be instrumental in
obtaining some Gold Skulltulas in Dodongo's Cavern, as well as the Fire Temple.

If you've forgotten the song that you played for the Scarecrow (or never played
a song for him in the first place), then return to the Temple of Time, where
Sheik will teach you how to return to Link's childhood, letting you teach
Pierre a new song.

Once you have the Scarecrow's Song, head for Lon Lon Ranch (but only if you've
awoken Talon, otherwise... head back to the Temple of Time).

------------------------
Lon Lon Ranch (daytime)
New Upgrade: Your Own Personal Uh... Cow

If you've awoken Talon as part of the Biggoron Sword Trading Sequence, then he
will have returned to the Ranch, and Malon will now let you participate in a
time trial run around the course on Epona.  Complete the course and beat
Malon's best time, and Malon will reward you with your own personal Cow back at
Link's House in Kokiri Forest.  Slightly useless?  Yes.  Completely awesome?
Absolutely.

To complete the course, hug the inside wall and use a Carrot just before each
hurdle in the fence (for the pair of extremely low hurdles one-third of the way
through the course, only use one carrot to clear them both.  Use the long,
empty stretch before the last hurdle to recover your carrots.  On the last leg
of the second lap, burn all of your carrots in one go.  If Epona refuses to
jump over the fence (which seems to happen a lot more then it should), then
you'll basically have to forfeit and start over.  Run back to the checkpoint to
reset the match.  If you can't manage it or just don't want to deal with it,
then go ahead and skip this.  It's an incredibly tough challenge for a
relatively worthless award, so it's no big deal.

Once you have the Cow (or don't), head back to the Temple of Time in Hyrule
Castle Market.

---------------
Temple of Time
New Song: The Prelude of Light

Run back into the Master Sword chamber, and Sheik will teach you the Prelude of
Light.  This song will warp you straight to the Temple of Time, much in the
same way that the Minuet of Forest takes you straight to the Forest Temple.
This is useful later in the game as it will let you return to the Temple of
Time and return to Link's Childhood quickly.  We get it now since we're going
to be returning to Link's childhood briefly in a little while.

Once you have the song, head back out of the Temple and Hyrule Castle, and make
your way to Kakariko Village.  If you still haven't done the Big Poe sidequest,
then you may want to consider doing that now.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

You should have broken the fifty mark on Gold Skulltulas while you were in the
Forest Temple, so you should now go to the House of Skulltula.

-------------------
House of Skulltula
New Quest Item: Piece of Heart x1 [HP20]

Get the reward for Fifty Skulltulas, which is a Piece of Heart.  Also, if you
skipped the 40 Skulltula reward, get it now.  Which is Bombchus.  Exciting.
Once you have the items, return to Kakariko Village.  You're now done gathering
Skulltula rewards for a while.  You won't have to return until you have all one
hundred Skulltulas.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Head for the building across from the Windmill, which was the unfinished
structure in Link's childhood.  Enter it.

------------------------------------
Kakariko Village - Shooting Gallery
New Equipment: Arrow Quiver x40

This shooting game is identical to the Shooting Gallery from Link's childhood,
only now the order is completely random.  Keep playing the game until you nail
all of the targets in one go, and the clerk will reward you with the first
Quiver upgrade.  Cherish it, as it will be the only Quiver upgrade you get
until almost the end of the game.

The order is as follows:
1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Note number 2: if a single blue rupee comes from the left, then the next one
will ALWAYS come from the right, despite the randomness of the rest of it.
Keep this in mind.  Also, if you memorize the patterns that the targets appear
in, then you can predict what will appear next, and you can always tell what
the last pattern will be by simply looking at what has already appeared.

Once you have the quiver, return to Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Head north out of the village to Death Mountain Trail.

---------------------
Death Mountain Trail

Go up the path from the foot of Death Mountain Trail, dodging the boulders that
come crashing down along the way.  If you got the Scarecrow's Song from Lake
Hylia, then head into Dodongo's Cavern now to get the last Gold Skulltula in
there.  Otherwise, head up the trail to Goron City and scroll down to the part
of the guide with the heading "Goron City."

-------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Antechamber

If you're wondering that we're doing here again, it's because we're going after
one last Gold Skulltula which has been eluding you here.  Those things are a
real nuisance, aren't they?  To save time getting out of the dungeon, use
Farore's Wind here so you can warp out quickly.

Run forward, out to the elevator and to the middle platform in front of the
giant Dodongo Skull.  Go to the right onto the next elevator, and jump out to
the lower ledge (do not ride the elevator up).  Once on the ledge, head back
towards the southern edge of the room and go through the darkened tunnel on the
left at the south edge of the ledge.

----------------------------------------
Dodongo's Cavern - Lower Southeast Hall
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS055]

Run forward into the hall, and kill the trio of Baby Dodongo's who come out of
the ground.  Remember to watch out; they explode.  Run forward down the hall
until Navi flutters up towards the ceiling.  Stop and play the Scarecrow's
Song.  Pierre the Scarecrow will magically appear on the cliff above.  Use the
Hookshot on Pierre to pull yourself up onto the cliff, and kill the Gold
Skulltula behind Pierre.  Take it's token, then return to the start of the
dungeon by walking or using Farore's Wind.  Go back out to Death Mountain Trail
and use the Magic Leaf out front of Dodongo's Cavern to ride up to Goron City
(the Leaf won't be there if you didn't plant the Magic Bean as Young Link, in
which case you'll have to walk).

-----------------------
Goron City (nighttime)
New Equipment: Goron Tunic
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS056]

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to, then run down the rope
bridges to the platform suspended over the middle of Goron City.  There is a
Gold Skulltula clinging to the back of this platform.  Go to one of the ropes
on the left or right sides of the platform, and climb out far enough so that
you can see the Skulltula on the back of the platform.  Kill it and take it's
token with the Hookshot.

Look down to the third floor (the level immediately beneath Goron City's top
floor), and you'll see a tiny little Goron rolling around there, much like the
Biggoron used to do as Young Link.  Jump down, and try to blow up the Goron
using Bombs to make him stop.  He's a coward though, and will roll in the
opposite direction if he gets too close to you.  Litter the ground with bombs
(or even use Bombchus) to hit him, and when he stops speak to him.  You may
even have to drop a bomb, let him roll past it, and then force him to roll in
the opposite direction and right into the bomb.  Sometimes this works better
then the more straight-forward method.

Speak with the Goron, and he'll reveal himself to be Link, Darunia's Son.
Speak with him, and after a while, he'll begin crying.  Ask him about the
Dragon when prompted, and he'll stop crying long enough to explain.  He'll then
start crying again.  Ask him about the Gorons, and he'll stop crying again, and
ask you to save them.  He'll then give you the Goron Tunic, and the door to
Darunia's Chamber will open.  Put on the Goron Tunic, which removes the time
limit in Death Mountain Crater and the Fire Temple.  Drop down to the bottom
floor and enter Darunia's Chamber.

In the back of Darunia's Chamber, there is a large stone block with a crude
carving of a Goron on it.  Grab onto the block and pull back to reveal a
doorway.  Go through it.

----------------------
Death Mountain Crater
New Song: The Bolero of Fire

Go to the left as you enter the Crater, and you will find a broken bridge.
Stand on the edge of the bridge, and use the Hookshot to pull yourself across
using the wooden beam hanging above the other side of the bridge as an anchor.
Run down the bridge a short ways, and Sheik will appear to teach your the
Bolero of Fire, the song that warps you to the Fire Temple at any time.

You're probably anxious to go on to the Fire Temple, but if you can spare the
time... head back to the Temple of Time using the Prelude of Light.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

Run back into the Master Sword chamber, and replace the Master Sword on it's
pedestal to return to Link's childhood.  Once you are back as Young Link, head
out of Hyrule Castle to the Market, and go back to the Garden (the large field
with the guards you snuck by earlier in the game).

-----------------------
Hyrule Castle - Garden
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS057]

You'll now have to sneak around back to the area where you first met Talon and
pushed around the Milk Crates so you could sneak into the Courtyard and meet
Zelda.  If you don't remember how to get by the guards, here's a lazy cut and
paste from earlier in the guide:

Climb up the ivy wall to the top (it has some rough spots where if you don't
climb up in just the right place, you'll fall off).  At the top, run forward a
bit, past the gossip stone, to the top of the large marble arch.  Drop down to
the ground on the other side of the arch, where you will land on the other side
of the gate which formerly blocked your path.  You probably don't realize it,
but you've already snuck past two of the guards.

This next part is the easily the hardest part of sneaking through the Garden.
You need to run up the hill to the left at an exact angle.  There are three
graphical breaks in the hill (thank god for N64's visible sprites, otherwise
this would be nearly impossible to describe).  The place you need to run up is
the third break in the hill, approximately near it's center.  Go straight up
the hill, and at the top there is a cluster of flowers.  Run straight at these
flowers, then begin running forward and slightly to the left until you reach a
wall.  Part of the wall is tiled with some bricks; climb up these bricks.

At the top of the brick wall, run straight forward, past another gossip stone.
Jump straight off the cliff, and go right into the moat.  Swim down to the end
of the moat until it breaks left, then climb up onto the small patch of dirt,
and from there climb up to the stone platform.

As you climb out of the moat, there is a tree to your right sitting at the
corner of the fence.  Stand beneath this tree and play the Song of Storms to
make a pit appear.  Drop down into this pit.  There are three bombable walls in
this pit, one in front of you as you enter, one to the left and one to the
right.  Bomb the wall on the left (it's slightly behind you from where you
land), to reveal a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token, then return to
the Garden.  Run back in the opposite direction you came from while riding the
moat and allow one of the Guards to spot you.  The guard will throw you back
outside the gate.  Head for Hyrule Field and go to Zora's River in the east
part of the zone.

-------------
Zora's River
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x2 [HP21] [HP22]

Go upstream to the Musical Frogs, and play them the Song of Storms, plus any
other songs which you haven't played for them yet.  When you play the Song of
Storms, then they will give you a Piece of Heart.  But wait, it's not over yet!
You can also play a minigame with the Frogs to win ANOTHER Piece of Heart.
Play the rest of the basic songs (Zelda's Lullaby, Epona's Song, Sun's Song,
Saria's Song, Song of Storms and Song of Time), and the Musical Frogs will
challenge you with another minigame.  Stand on the log and whip out the Ocarina
to play the game.

Flies will appear above the Frog's heads, and you must press the button
associated with that frog to make him eat it.  The lowest frog is matched with
the A Button, and the remaining four frogs in the cross-shape are matched to
each direction on the C-Pad.  You've got to go fast.  VERY fast.  Ridiculously
fast.  It takes practice, and persistence.  Memorizing the order is very
helpful.  Luckily, I have transcribed the order for you.

The order is as follows:
A Button, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down, A Button, C-Down, A
Button, C-Down, C-Right, C-Left, A Button

Once you have both Pieces of Heart from the Musical Frogs, play the Bolero of
Fire to warp to Death Mountain Crater.

----------------------
Death Mountain Crater
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS058]

Without the protection of the Goron Tunic, your time here is limited before you
die from the heat, so let's be quick.  Begin by looking to the left from where
you warp in, where you will find one of those elusive patches of soft earth.
Drop a Bottled Bug into it (you haven't thrown it away, have you!?), but
remember to recapture one of the three who comes out.  Kill the Gold Skulltula
and take it's token, then plant one of your two remaining Magic Beans in the
patch.  Play the Prelude of Light to return to the Temple of Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

Take the Master Sword once more to return to Adulthood, and play the Bolero of
Fire to head back to Death Mountain Crater.

----------------------
Death Mountain Crater
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x2 [HP23] [HP24]

The Magic Beans you planted not five minutes ago have sprouted into a Magic
Leaf already.  Hurray for Time Travel!  Board the Magic Leaf and ride it up.
Near the start of it's path, it will pass by a tall pile of rubble with a Piece
of Heart on top and loop around it several times.  Jump off the leaf onto the
pile of rubble to get the Heart Piece.

Drop back down to the Triforce Pedestal, and board the Magic Leaf once more.
This time, ride it around it's course until it passes close to the high cliff
near the south entrance.  The Leaf will pass briefly by a large rock right near
the cliff face; this is your opportunity to jump out to the cliff.

Run to the left a short ways from where you have landed, and position the
camera so that you can see the cliff wall below you.  It has an odd texture.
You can actually climb on this wall.  Walk slowly off the cliff to grab hold of
the rock face, and climb down a short distance to an alcove halfway down the
cliff face.  Climb below the alcove, then climb up into it (if you try to drop
down from above, you'll just fall right into the lava).  Take the Piece of
Heart, then play the Bolero of Fire to warp back down to the pedestal (it's
faster then climbing back up).

From the pedestal, head north across the bridge and into the large stone
structure.  Climb down the ladder into the pit, and enter the doorway adjacent
to the ladder to enter the Fire Temple.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

Structurally speaking a very small dungeon, the Fire Temple is nevertheless a
fairly long dungeon thanks to the large amount of backtracking you must do to
complete it.  The boss' chamber is literally next door to the entrance.  The
challenge in reaching it is in activating the bridge which leads to his door,
which can only be accessed at the dungeon's top-most floor.  The dungeon is
also unique in that Keys aren't really hidden, but are instead sort-of rewards
for rescuing the Gorons trapped in the dungeon.  Even the Boss Key is held by
one of the Gorons.  Rescuing all of them is a necessary, if tedious, part of
the dungeon.

--------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Entrance Hall

Run up the stairs as you enter, watching out for the Fire Keese who flap around
above.  Kill them with arrows if you like, then head through the door on the
left at the top of the stairs.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Pillar Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

In this room you'll meet with Darunia.  He'll run off to fight Volvagia, and
begs Link to rescue the Gorons who are being held prisoner in the Fire Temple.
Ignore Darunia's advice that the Gorons are being held in the opposite
direction.  There's actually a Goron in this very room who you have to rescue
first.

Look to the left after the cutscene, and you'll see a number of pillars rising
out of the lava.  Jump out to these pillars, and along them to the platform in
the left corner of the room.  Step onto the switch to open the cell directly in
front of you.  Speak with the Goron inside to free him, then open the chest in
his cell to find a Small Key.  Return to the door you came through and go
through it (if you need Fairies, there are two of them on the right side of the
room).

--------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Entrance Hall

Watch out for the Fire Keese; they're back, whether you killed them last time
you were here or not.  Run straight across the room and enter the door on the
other side.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Cavern

Run to the left side of this large room.  You can work your way along the
series of platforms in the middle of the room, or you can go along the border
of the room, or you can just march right through the lava.  It's your pick.
Jump up to the ledge on the left side of the room, where there is a sandstone
platform with a Block of Time sitting on top of it.  Ignore the Block of Time
for now.  Enter the alcove beneath the block and go through the door inside.

-------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Prison Corridor #1
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run down to the end of the hall and step on the switch to open the cell door.
Speak with the Goron and open the chest inside to get another Small Key.
Return to the previous room.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Cavern

Run back out to the edge of the sandstone platform, and turn around to face the
Block of Time above you.  Navi will flutter up by it if you're standing in the
right place.  Play the Song of Time to make the block change positions,
blocking the door you just came through.  Climb up onto the Block of Time, and
go through the door on top of the sandstone platform.

-----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Killer Tile Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS059]

As soon as you enter this room, a series of tiles will rise up from the floor
and hurl themselves at you.  Put your back to the wall and hold up your shield
to block these tiles.  Don't move until all of the tiles in the room have
stopped attacking.  Near the back of the room is a strange, pulsating creature.
This is a Like-Like, a relatively weak enemy who does possess the rather
annoying ability to eat your Clothes and Hylian Shield.  Slash him to death
(use the Biggoron Sword if you have it), and if he manages to swallow you,
reclaim your stolen items after he dies.  Kill the Gold Skulltula on the wall
and take it's token, then return to the previous room.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Cavern

Head to the opposite side of the cavern.  Again, work your way along all of the
platforms in the center of the room, make your way around on the perimeter, or
just run straight across the lava to get there.  Watch out for Fire Keese on
the way.  On the other side of the room is another sandstone platform.  Jump up
onto it and use a Bomb on the oddly-colored wall to reveal a door.  Go through
it.

-------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Prison Corridor #2
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run forward and step on the switch to open the prison cell directly in front of
you.  Speak with the Goron and open the chest in his cell to get another Small
Key.  Return to the previous room.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Cavern

Head to the door on the north side of the room and go through it.  It's the
door to the right as you come out of the Prison Corridor #2.

-----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Column Room

Run forward, and you will slide down a steep log bridge to the inside of the
cage that takes up the predominant portion of the room.  Grab onto the wall of
this cage and climb to it's top level.  At the top of the wire wall there is a
pair of platforms that stretch out over the room below.  Climb up onto one of
these platforms (you may have to walk very slowly along the edge of the cage
wall), and jump down onto one of the sandstone platforms below.  Watch out for
Keese.

On the east sandstone pillar, there is a massive block.  Get behind this block
and push it off the ledge, onto the huge column of lava that periodically
bursts in the middle of the room.  Jump down and stand on the block, and use it
as an elevator to reach the upper level the next time the lava column erupts.
At the top of the "elevator shaft," get off the block and enter the door in the
small room.

------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Three-Tiered Room

Go to the left as you come out of the door, and hop up onto the sandstone
ledge.  Defeat the Fire Slug by attacking it aggressively (put up your Shield
if it expands into a large column-shape; it's about to attack if it does).
Once it is dead, climb up to the next sandstone ledge on the right and kill
another Fire Slug.  Jump across to the adjacent ledge, which has a large stone
block and a strange diamond object.  This diamond object is actually a new kind
of switch.  Don't hit it yet.

Push the stone block off the ledge (it can only be pushed one way) so that it
lands in the stone track below.  Jump down and get in front of the block, and
pull it backwards into position on the stone face carved into the floor.  Climb
back up to the platform with the Diamond Switch on it.  Don't activate it yet.
Jump out to the stone platform, and look to the left on the other side to see
another ledge.  Jump to this ledge.

Climb up the wire wall on the left as you land on the next ledge, and move to
the edge of the cliff so that you can see the Diamond Switch below (you may
have to drop to a lower tier).  Drop a bomb off the cliff so that it lands near
the Diamond Switch, and quickly climb onto the ledge behind you.  The bomb's
explosion will activate the switch, temporarily removing the pillar of flames
that surrounds the wire wall.  Climb up this new wire wall to the top level,
and go through the door at the top.

-------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Boulder Maze
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS060]

Like most of the mazes you've encountered so far, this is only a maze in the
strictest sense of the term.  All of the goodies in this room are located on
the outside wall, so hug the outside wall as much as possible and you won't
miss anything.  Use your common sense to avoid the boulders that ricochet
around the room.  Each of them follow preset paths, and have the ability to
stop and change directions even where it would not logically make sense for
them to stop.

Go left as you enter the room, and keeping your right side to the outside wall,
keep running forward.  You'll quickly reach a corner that forms a small alcove,
with a low ceiling above.  You'll know you're in the right place, since the
camera will zoom in when you near the corner.  Use a Bomb to destroy the left
side of the wall (it isn't discolored, but if you strike it with your sword it
sounds hollow).  Kill the Gold Skulltula on the other side and take it's token.
Turn around and head back out into the maze, taking the first right you come
to.  Again keeping your right side to the wall, follow the perimeter of the
room.  You'll reach another small alcove with a door inside it.  Go through it.

-------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Prison Corridor #3
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run down the hall and step on the switch to free the Goron.  Speak with the
Goron, then open his chest to get another Small Key.  Return to the Boulder
Maze.

-------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Boulder Maze
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run forward and take the first right, once again following the perimeter wall
and keeping your right side to the wall.  You'll quickly reach another locked
door.  Ignore it for now; keep moving along the perimeter of the maze, always
keeping your right side to the wall.  Once you make it around to the far left
side of the room, you will happen across a Goron's prison cell which is at the
end of a dead end in the maze.  Step on the switch in front of the cell to open
it, and speak with the Goron inside.  Take his key.  Return to the locked door
we passed earlier and go through it.

-----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Narrow Span Room

This room contains three narrow bridges which all meet at one central point.
Be careful you don't fall, or else you'll fall back down to the Lava Cavern
near the dungeon's entrance.  Shoot the Silver Eye on the wall with an arrow to
unlock the sealed door on the right from where you enter.  Move slowly along
the narrow bridges and go through the unsealed door.

------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Curtain Room
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

Look to the right as you enter to find a chest which contains the Dungeon Map.
Once you have it, return to the previous room.

-----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Narrow Span Room

Enter the locked door on your right as you come out from the Lava Curtain room.

------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Curtain Room

You're back in the Lava Curtain Room now, on the other side of the large fence
that blocked you a few seconds ago when you got the Dungeon Map.

Run out along the narrow bridge, and jump onto the wire floor that is suspended
above the lava.  Step forward a few steps, and a curtain of lava will erupt up
from the floor, and chase you along the wire platform.  Run all the way along
the wire platform (the curtain moves slowly and is easy to dodge), and jump
across to the next wire platform at the gap.  Keep running along the new wire
platform, jump onto a third wire platform, and jump again onto the large
sandstones steps on the other side of the platform.  Climb to the top of the
stairs and go through the door on the left.

-------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Boulder Maze
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

You're now on top of the Boulder Maze, and you're able to jump along the walls
that form the maze below.  If you fall off, you'll have to return to the top of
the maze through the Narrow Span and Lava Curtain rooms.

Jump across to the platform directly in front of you, and kill the Lava Slug.
There is a huge gash in the floor here, where you can drop a bomb to open a
really long pit that drops down.  We'll get to that in a moment.  Look to the
right, and you'll see a long narrow platform that stretches out towards the
opposite wall.  Jump out onto this platform and run along it.  At the end of
the platform, look to the left to see another large platform with a Lava Slug
on top of it.

Jump out to this platform and kill the Lava Slug.  Look to the left once more
to see a small platform with a switch.  Jump out to the switch and step on it.
A cell door on the far side of the room will open, revealing another Goron.
Jump along the platforms all the way to the left side of the room.  Kill the
Lava Slug before you even attempt the jump into the Goron's cell.  Speak with
the Goron and open his chest to get another Small Key.

Return to the large platform with the huge gash in it that we passed earlier.
Drop a bomb onto this gash, and the explosion will reveal a massive pit.  Drop
down to the bottom of this pit.

------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Three-Tiered Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run down the hall and around the corner to find another switch.  Step on it,
and the Goron's double-sided cell doors will open.  Speak with the Goron and
open his chest to get another Small Key.  Turn around and go back down the
hall, and use the wire wall to climb back up to the Boulder Maze.  You can also
use this Goron's cell as a shortcut to quickly return to the Boulder Maze if
you accidentally fall back to the Lava Cavern in this dungeon's many pits.

-------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Boulder Maze

It's time to use the Scarecrow's Song to get two of the game's most elusive
Gold Skulltulas.  If you don't have the Scarecrow's Song yet, then... tough
noogies for you.  Return to the Fire Curtain Room to continue with the dungeon.

Kill the Fire Slug as you climb out of the pit from the Three-Tiered Room.
From the top of the pit, look up and to the left to see an oddly shaped
platform on the wall.  Navi will flutter up near it if you get close enough.
Play the Scarecrow's Song, and Pierre the Scarecrow will appear up on the
platform.  Use the Hookshot to pull yourself up to him.  It helps if you play
the song just to the right of the door that leads back to the Lava Curtain
room, but you'll have to move back to the next platform over to hit Pierre with
the Hookshot.  You may not necessarily be able to see the red targeting dot on
Pierre, but try firing anyway.  The Hookshot travels just a tiny bit farther
then the red dot does.

Once you have pulled yourself up to Pierre, look to the right and you will see
a floating platform with a circular hookshot target on it.  Pull yourself over
to this platform, and the platform will begin to rise.  Ride the elevator to
the top of the shaft, and go through the door adjacent to the elevator.

----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Two-Tiered Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS061]

Turn right from the door and go around the corner.  Climb the wire mesh to the
next level, and look to the wire mesh in the corner to spy a Gold Skulltula.
Kill it and take it's token, then climb to the top of the next wire mesh wall.
Go through the door at the top of the mesh.

----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Time Trial Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS062]

As soon as you enter the room, walk forward to the edge of the cliff and look
to the left to spy another Gold Skulltula hanging on the cliff wall above the
pit.  Kill it and take it's token with the Hookshot.  The pit below actually
leads to the Narrow Spawn Room, so unless 200 rupees sounds like fun to you,
you can drop off the cliff to the room below.  Make sure that you position
yourself so that you land on one of the bridges below, otherwise you'll plummet
all the way back down to the Flame Cavern near the start of the dungeon.

If you really want that 200 rupees, then step on the switch to the right of the
(now dead) Gold Skulltula.  The pillar of flames surrounding the chest at the
top of the room will now disappear, and you have a limited to time to open the
chest before the flames return.  To reach the chest, run up and around the
circular path hugging the inside of the circle.  When the hill becomes too
steep to climb, use the Hookshot on the Hookshot target.  From there, run
towards the chest until you slide down off the hill, and use the Hookshot on
the chest to pull yourself towards it, and open it before the time runs out.
Even if you're very good at this, it'll be a close shave.

Once you have the 200 rupees, then drop down to the Narrow Span room through
the pit in the center of the room.  I'll say it again, make sure you position
yourself so that you land on one of the platforms below, or else you will
plummet all the way back to the start of the dungeon.

-----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Narrow Span Room

Head through the south door (to the right of the sealed door, closest to the
silver eye target) to return to the Lava Curtain Room.

------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lava Curtain Room

Run along the narrow ledge and jump back onto the wire mesh platform.  Run
along the mesh platform and jump out to the next one.  On your left, there is a
piece of the platform that juts out very close to the sandstone ledge near the
west-center of the room.  Jump from this piece of the platform up to the
sandstone ledge (it looks like a jump you can't make, but you can).  Go through
the locked door.

--------------------------------
The Fire Temple - West Corridor

Go down the corridor and through the door on the other side.

---------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Fire Trap Room

This room is positively littered with fire-based traps, from statues that
breath fire to invisible walls that burst into flame when you draw too near
them.

From the door, run to the right and off the ledge where there a number of posts
embedded in the ground.  Some of these posts generate a wall of flames if you
draw too close, but others do not.  You have to navigate this maze of flames to
reach the door on the on the other side.

Keeping the wall on your right side, move slowly forward until a wall of flames
appears in your path.  Go to the left (watch out for a roving boulder), and
take a right immediately after passing the first post on your right.  Go right
again and head back towards the wall to find a door.  Go through it.

-----------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Compass Corridor
New Dungeon Item: Compass

Run to the end of the hall and open the chest to find the Compass.  Return to
the previous room.

---------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Fire Trap Room

Make your way back through the walls of flames and the roving boulders to the
door that you used to first enter this room.  Run to the left from the door,
hugging the wall and keeping it on your left side.  Watch out for the boulder
that rolls around here, and turn right after the first post, and walk slowly
forward until a wall of flames appears in your path.  Go left, and go slightly
left and up to pass between a wide gap of posts.  Take a left when a wall of
flames appears in your path, then run to the wall (watch out for the boulder)
and hang a right.

Watch out for the giant totem pole here; the faces spit fire.  Hug the wall and
go around, keeping your left side facing the wall.  Smash the pots on the way
to get recovery hearts, and avoid the flames from the totem pole.  When another
wall of flames appears in your path, go right and pass between the pair of
poles directly in front of you.  Take a left immediately on the other side, and
you'll reach the door.  Go through it.

-------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Two-Floored Prison

You can't do much to help this Goron just yet.  Go straight across the hall and
through the door on the other side.

---------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Fire Trap Room

You're now on the opposite side of the Fire Trap Room, trapped behind another
maze of fire walls.  Go forward between the pair of posts directly in front of
you, then pass between the pair directly in front of and to your right.  Run
forward until you hit another wall of flames, then go to the left until you
touch the wall.  Keeping your right side to the wall, run forward until you
reach another fire wall, with a switch just on the other side.

Go to the left and pass between the pair of posts just to the left of the fire
wall, and you can reach the switch.  The giant curtain of flames on the north
side of the room will now disappear.  Temporarily.  You have to reach the north
side of the room before the curtain returns.

Run back through the gap that you just came through, then look to the right
where you will see a long aisle of posts on the left and right.  Run straight
down this aisle towards the north side of the room, and you should reach the
wall just before the curtain returns.  Run into the small alcove where there is
a door.  But don't open it; it's a dummy door, which will crush you if you try
to open it.  Blow up the door with a bomb.  The dummy door will disappear,
revealing another door.  Go through this one.

------------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Upper Flare Dancer Room

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Flare Dancer

As soon as you enter the room, a Flare Dancer will appear.  These unique
enemies aren't that hard, since they can be defeated without them ever getting
the chance to attack you.  If you have the Biggoron Sword, then use it for a
faster victory.

To damage the Flare Dancer, the first thing you must do is separate it's heart
from it's flaming body using the Hookshot.  Once this is done, the heart will
literally begin running around the room very quickly.  Begin circling the room
in the opposite direction so that you intercept it halfway around the room, and
use a jump attack to deal damage to it (use a regular strike if you have
difficulty timing the jump attack).

After a time, the Flare Dancer will jump back into the pillar of flames in the
middle of the room, and reignite his flaming body.  Steal his heart with the
Hookshot again, and the process starts over.  The Flare Dancer progressively
changes colors depending on how much damage he has taken.  When he sprouts
green flames, then he is nearly dead.  If the Flare Dancer does manage to get
off an attack, then he will create a bunch of tiny flames which will pursue you
around the room.  Not terribly dangerous.

Once the Flare Dancer is dead, then the pillar of flames in the middle of the
room will disappear.  Climb up onto the platform in the middle of the room, and
it will begin to rise.  Go through the door at the top of the shaft.

------------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - The Diamond Switch Room

A diamond switch lies directly to your right as you enter.  Ignore it for the
moment.  Instead, run right around the corner and climb the wire mesh wall to
the second floor.  Once up here, drop a bomb down to the bottom floor, right
next to the diamond switch.  The explosion will remove the pillar of flames
that surround the mesh ladder leading to the next level.  Climb this ladder
quickly to avoid the regenerating pillar of flames, and go through the door at
the top.

-------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - The Tippy-Top Room
New Item: Megaton Hammer

This is the highest point of the Fire Temple, and contains a timed puzzle
similar to the one you completed earlier for the 200 rupees (if you missed the
Scarecrow Song, then you missed that room).  Climb up onto the ledge across
from the door, and step on the switch to make a pillar of flames surrounding a
chest near the top of the room disappear.  To reach the chest before time runs
out, then you have to run up the narrow staircase on the inside of the giant
ring that the room creates.  It isn't as hard as it looks or sounds.  If you
have to, go a little more slowly, and Hookshot the chest to pull yourself
quickly to the chest at the top of the stairset.  This is a little less
reliable, but is also less reckless and might be easier for new players.

Once you have the Megaton Hammer, jump off the cliff to the right of the chest
to return to where you came in.  Stand on the large stone face coming out of
the floor, and smash the face with the Megaton Hammer.  The block will fall
down to the room below.  In the corner of the room is another totem pole (this
one doesn't breath flame).  Smash it with the Megaton Hammer from the left or
right until both pieces are gone to reveal a door.  Go through it.

----------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Hidden Staircase Room

Run forward (watch out for Fire Keese), and look to the right where there is a
small stone block that rises out of the pit in the ground.  Smash the face with
the Megaton Hammer, and a stairwell will appear inside the pit.  Grab one of
the wooden boxes behind you and then run down the stairs (watch out for more
Fire Keese).  Drop the wooden box onto the blue switch at the bottom of the
stairs to unseal the door.  Go through the door.

---------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Fire Trap Room

You're now in a hidden chamber high above the Fire Trap Room.  Stand on the
stone block in the corner and smash it with the Megaton Hammer to fall to the
floor below.  The stone block has created a booster that lets you access doors
in this room that were previously out of your reach.  Jump from the block up to
the higher ledge.  There is a sealed door here, with a rusty switch besides it.
Smash the rusted switch with your Megaton Hammer to unseal the door.  Go
through it.

-------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Two-Floored Prison
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run forward to the edge of the cliff, and Navi will flutter over to a Block of
Time on the other side of the room.  Play the Song of Time to transport it down
to the floor.  The Block will block a door in the corner, but that's okay.  We
don't need to go through it.  Jump across to the opposite ledge, and smash the
rusty switch with the Megaton Hammer to open the cell below.  Drop down and
speak with the Goron in the cell, then take the Key from the chest in his cell.
Use the Block of Time to return to the second level of the room, and go back
out the door that you came through.

---------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Fire Trap Room

Directly in front of you as you come out of the door is a large stone block
which is held in place by a stone scaffolding.  Jump out to the block, stand on
top of it and smash the block with the Megaton Hammer.  Ride the block all the
way down to it's destination far below.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Pillar Room

Look familiar?  This is the room where you met Darunia at the start of the
dungeon.  But we still don't have the Boss Key, so we can't get in to help
Darunia.  Leave through the east door.

--------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Entrance Hall

Kill the pair of Fire Keese in the room, then drop down to the bottom floor and
go to the east side of the chamber.  Use the Megaton Hammer to smash the pieces
of the totem pole away (make sure to stand on the left or right side of the
totem) to reveal a door.  Go through it.

--------------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - The Room of Fiery Enemies

In this room you will encounter a large number of Fire Keese and Fire Slugs.
To get the upperhand right from the start, prepare a Super Spin Attack by
holding the attack button as soon as you enter the room, then slowly edge into
the room.  As soon as you reach the center of the room, or just before you are
attacked (whichever comes first), unleash the Super Spin Attack.  With any luck
(or with the Biggoron Sword) this will kill all enemies in the room in one hit.
Kill any leftovers, and the sealed door on the other end of the room will open.
Go through it.

-------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Deja Vu Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS063]

This room should be familiar.  Put your back to a wall and block the flying
tiles with your shield.  Kill the Like-Like, then kill the Gold Skulltula and
take it's token.  Haven't we done this before?  Leave through the door on the
west side of the room.

------------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Lower Flare Dancer Room

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Flare Dancer

Defeat another Flare Dancer here.  This one is identical to the last one.
Remember to use the Biggoron Sword if you have it.  Don't bother with the
Megaton Hammer; it attacks too slowly.

Once the Flare Dancer is dead, then his pillar of flames disappears, revealing
a chest.  Open the chest to get some... bombs.  Gee, thanks.  Leave through the
door in the south of the room.

---------------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Boss Key Prison Room
New Dungeon Item: Boss Key

Use the Megaton Hammer to smash the rusted switch, opening the double-sided
cell.  Speak with the Goron, then open the ornate chest to find the Boss Key.
Leave through the door in south of the room.

--------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Entrance Hall

Go back up the stairs and through the west door.  Watch out for Fire Keese
along the way.

------------------------------
The Fire Temple - Pillar Room

With the pillar from the Fire Trap room knocked down to this point, you can now
jump across to the Boss Key door that you couldn't reach the last time you were
here (not that it mattered, since you didn't have the key anyway).  Jump across
to the door, and go through it.

-------------B-O-S-S--------------
Subterranean Lava Dragon VOLVAGIA
New Upgrade: Heart Container x1
New Quest Item: Fire Medallion

Volvagia isn't so much a Subterranean Lava Dragon as he is a Giant Flaming
Whack-A-Mole Dragon.  Nevertheless, this is one of the coolest and most
cinematic fights in the whole game, so enjoy it while you're here.  Jump out to
the large slab of rock in the middle of the cavern, and run to the middle of
the platform to begin the fight.

In Volvagia's first phase, he appears randomly in one of the nine pits that dot
the battlefield.  You'll know which pit he'll appear in, as a large amount of
smoke and cinders will appear around the pit.  Run towards this pit, and
Volvagia's head will emerge.  Smash his head with the Megaton Hammer (use a
Jump Attack with the Megaton Hammer for best results), and it will briefly stun
Volvagia.  At this point, you can get one more attack in on him.  So make it a
Jump Attack with the Biggoron Sword for best results (if you don't have the
Biggoron Sword, then the Megaton Hammer is a decent substitute).  If you take
too long to stun Volvagia, then he will attack you, and appear in a different
pit so you can try again.

In his second phase, Volvagia will emerge from one of the pits (again, you can
tell which ones by the smoke and cinders that appear around the pit) and fly
around the room, chasing you and trying to breath fire on you.  The easiest way
to avoid damage in this phase is to just run continuously to the left or right
in a small circle, preferably near the center of the battlefield.  After a
time, Volvagia will dive back into one of the pits and revert to his first
phase.  This time, however, he'll try to trick you by changing which pit he
comes out of just before he emerges.

After you damage Volvagia again, then he will emerge from the pits once more
and begin flying towards the ceiling.  The roof will begin to fall, raining the
battlefield with boulders.  Easily the best way to avoid this form of attack is
to just run to the edge of the battlefield and hang off the edge.  After the
boulders stop falling, then Volvagia will dive back into a pit in the ground,
and revert to his first phase, this time bouncing between even more pits before
finally emerging from one.  If Volvagia is not dead by this point, then he will
begin changing back and forth between Phase 2 and Phase 3, always alternating
back to Phase 1 so you can damage him.

After Volvagia dies, then take the Heart Container that appears and enter the
ring of light to meet the Sage of Fire, Darunia.  Death Mountain will also be
healed from it's curse.  With the unfortunate side effect being that it no
longer looks frickin' badass.

----------------------
Death Mountain Crater

There's still one last thing in Death Mountain Crater to be found before we
leave here forever.  From the Triforce pedestal where you land after freeing
Darunia, head to the left towards the shattered plank bridge.  Use the Hookshot
to pull yourself over to the other side of the bridge (target the planks
hanging off the cliff and climb up them like a ladder).  Run to the left on the
other side of the bridge, past the door that leads from Goron's City.  Head
across the drawbridge here.

On the other side of the drawbridge, there are two rocks which can be seen
covering the entrance to a doorway, which is only partially visible.  Use the
Megaton Hammer to smash the rocks and enter the doorway (you may have to smash
the rocks multiple times), which turns out to be a Great Fairy Fountain.

-----------------------
Great Fairy's Fountain
New Upgrade: Magic Meter x2

Run into the fountain and stand on the Triforce symbol.  Play Zelda's Lullaby
while standing on the symbol, and the Great Fairy of Bondage will appear and
double the size of your magic meter.  Return to Death Mountain Crater.

----------------------
Death Mountain Crater

As you come out of the Great Fairy's Fountain, you'll find yourself practically
thrown right into another gray rock.  Smash it with the Megaton Hammer, and
you'll open a path leading up to upper Death Mountain Crater.  Jump over to the
ladder and climb to it's top.  At the top of the ladder, head for the southwest
corner of the map and go down the tunnel.  Head out the cave mouth on the other
side.

---------------------------------
Death Mountain Trail (nighttime)
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS064] [GS065]

You're done in Death Mountain Crater and the Fire Temple now, so if Link's
stylish red threads aren't your thing, you can switch back to the Kokiri Tunic
if you like.

If you are choosing to do the Biggoron Sword Trading Sequence as you play
through the game, then do Part VI in the appropriate Subchapter, then continue
on with the guide from this point.

Drop down from the peak of Death Mountain to the long path leading up to the
cliff face, where you are normally pelted with burning rocks while trying to
make your way up.  Smash the first red rock on the left with the Megaton
Hammer, and you'll find a Gold Skulltula (if it isn't there, then make sure
it's nighttime).  Take it's token, then continue down Death Mountain to the
area near Goron's City.

Head for the cliff above Dodongo's Cavern (where you threw the Bomb Flower down
as Young Link to unseal Dodongo's Cavern).  There's another red rock here.
Smash it with the Megaton Hammer to find another Gold Skulltula (again, it must
be nighttime).  Kill it and take it's token.  You're done on Death Mountain
now, so play the Prelude of Light to return to the Temple of Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

Return to Hyrule Field and make your way to Zora's River, on the east side of
Hyrule Field.

-------------------------
Zora's River (nighttime)
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS066] [GS067]

There are a pair of Gold Skulltulas here in Zora's River, so if you planted the
Magic Beans as a child then ignore the Magic Leaf for the moment.  Run forward
from where you enter, and jump across the river at the same place you used to
jump across as a kid (you may have to kill the Octorok first).  Run upstream to
the next point where you must jump across the river, but don't jump across yet.
If it isn't nighttime, then play the Sun's Song now, face the south wall and
look up.  You'll see a Gold Skulltula high on the wall.  Unfortunately, you
can't reach it from here.

Turning back north, jump across the gap in the river.  Run forward towards the
Octoroks in the water, and just wade straight into the river.  Adult Link is
tall enough that he can walk in most places of the river without being swept
downstream.  Run east upstream, past the former home of the Musical Frogs.  Run
around the corner and start heading back west, and onto the small ledge which
you used Cuccos to reach with Young Link.  Climb onto the ledge and up the
ladder.  At the top, face south again where you will see a cliff with a pit in
it.  Jump out to this ledge, but avoid the pit.  You're now in range of that
Gold Skulltula that we passed earlier.  Make it nighttime if you need to, then
nail the Gold Skulltula and take it's token with the Hookshot.

Make your way back upstream until you near the Zora's Domain waterfall.  Near
the end of the wooden drawbridge just before the waterfall, if you look on the
northwestern wall you will find another Gold Skulltula.  You may need to stand
on the fence to reach it with the Hookshot.  Shoot for the Gold Skulltula even
if you can't get the targeting reticule to appear; the Hookshot travels
slightly farther then it's targeting system shows.

Once you have both of the Skulltulas in this zone, head to the Zora's Domain
waterfall, play Zelda's Lullaby to open the waterfall and enter Zora's Domain.

--------------------------
Zora's Domain (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS068]

If you though Death Mountain got screwed up, just check out what Ganondorf did
to Zora's Domain.

If it isn't nighttime, play the Sun's Song to make it so.  Climb to King Zora's
throne room near the top of the cavern, to find him encased in red ice (unless
you've already done the Biggoron Sword sequence, in which case he'll already be
free).  We'll free him in a moment (unless you've already freed him).  Head to
the left towards the top of the waterfall, and edge to the very edge of the
waterfall.  Look to the left to see a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's
token with the Hookshot, then return to King Zora's throne room.  Climb up to
the passage behind King Zora's throne and enter Zora's Fountain.

----------------
Zora's Fountain
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP25]

Run to the right from the entrance to Zora's Domain and onto Jabu-Jabu's
vacated altar.  Climb up the small bit of frozen hill, and jump out onto the
first of many frozen platforms.  Jump carefully along the ice platforms, and
when you reach the second one, you can choose to go north or north-east.  Go
north-east first to get a Piece of Heart.  The second set of ice platforms on
the way to the Piece of Heart steadily rotates.  Move slowly and come to a
complete stop before jumping to the next ice platform to make sure you don't
lose control (which is surprisingly easier then you'd think).

Once you have the Piece of Heart, head back to the giant platform and go north
along the ice platforms.  Jump along them to the northern edge of the pond and
into the massive cave mouth that has appeared here.  Enter the cave mouth to
reach the Ice Cavern.

Since the Ice Cavern is not divided by doors or other zones the way the rest of
the game is, I'm going to be diverting from my usual format for the guide.  The
Ice Cavern is going to be all one area, not divided up by separate rooms.
Sorry if this confuses you, but it was even more confusing when this part of
the walkthrough was divided up into separate rooms when the entire area is
technically one big room.

---------------
The Ice Cavern
New Quest Items: Gold Skulltula Token x3 [GS069] [GS070] [GS071]
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP26]
New Dungeon Items: Dungeon Map, Compass
New Item: Iron Boots
New Song: Serenade of Water

Go down the frozen corridor, destroying any stalagmites with your sword and
watching out for stalactites that fall from the ceiling.  When the room widens
out into a large room with a frozen floor, you'll meet three Freezzard enemies.
Defeat them with sword strikes or Din's Fire.  Don't try to struggle towards
them on the frozen ice.  Just use the Hookshot on them to pull yourself right
to them.  The Freezzards can freeze you solid using an ice breath attack, and
can move slowly around on the frozen floors, but are otherwise relatively
harmless.

Watching out for the Blade Trap that circles the room, head north into the next
hallway.  Slash your way through the four stalagmites dropping your path and
keep going down the path.  The next time the hall widens out, it will reveal a
large room with a huge spinning Giant Frozen Scythe Thing of Incredibly Painful
Death.

This room contains a number of Silver Rupees, which must be gathered to unlock
the door in the north end of the room so that you can progress onwards.  Three
of the rupees are located in plain sight, but are also located directly in the
path of the GFSTIPD.  If you time it properly, then you can roll under or even
backflip over the GFSTIPD, but it takes practice and skill.  There is another
silver rupee behind three blue stalagmites in the corner (to the left as you
first enter the room).  Kill the Gold Skulltula on the ceiling above while you
grab this rupee.  The last silver rupee hangs high above the room.  To reach
it, climb up the cliff in the rear of the room and jump out to the rupee.  The
door at the top of the cliff will now unlock.  Climb up and go through it.

Run down the hall, killing the Freezzard in your path while dodging the blade
trap.  Keep going down the hall until you enter a wider room.  This room
contains a new kind of Keese, the Ice Keese.  These guys are annoying.  Really
freaking annoying.  If they touch you, then they will freeze you solid.
However, unlike the Fire Keese, they do not lose their Ice effect after they
touch you.  Try and kill them from afar with arrows.  Use manual aiming if
possible.

Once all of the Ice Keese in the room are dead, climb up onto the ledge near
the front of the room.  Move slowly along it and kill the Freezzard at the end.
Once the Freezzard is dead, jump to the platform on the left, and jump again to
the next platform.  This platform contains a pillar which houses a pillar of
Blue Fire.  Blue fire can be used to melt the Red Ice that you've seen around
Zora's Domain.  Empty two of your Bottles (you'd better have at least two by
this point in the game), and fill them with Blue Fire.

From the Blue Fire, move to the left along the narrow bridge.  Kill the
Freezzard at the other end (he tends to hog up this part of the path, so use a
Jump Attack with the Biggoron Sword or a Megaton Hammer for a 1HKO).  Use the
Blue Fire on the large chest to the right of the (dead) Freezzard, and open it
to get the Dungeon Map (the pot frozen with Red Ice contains a fairy).  Make
sure you still have two Bottles with Blue Fire, then return to the room with
the Giant Frozen Scythe Thing of Incredibly Painful Death.

If you look to the left and right from the cliff where you emerge from the
Dungeon Map room, you'll see two bits of wall that have an odd reddish-tinge to
them near their base.  These are actually barriers which can be melted with
Blue Fire.  Melt the barrier on the left first, and go down the hall.  Run into
the middle of this small room, and quickly run in a small circle several times
to coax down all of the stalactites who threaten to fall from the ceiling.
Next, smash all of the stalagmites in the corners of the room, and kill the
Keese before they can use the Blue Flame to become Ice Keese.

Refill your empty bottle with Blue Flame, then use both of your bottles of Blue
Flame to melt the Red Ice covering the chest on the right side of the room, and
the Piece of Heart on the left side of the room.  Open the chest to get the
Compass.  When you get the Piece of Heart, look on the wall to the right to see
a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token.  Refill both of your empty
bottles with Blue Fire before returning to the room with the GFSTIPD.

Back in the GFSTIPD room, look for the next bit of wall with the red tinge at
it's base.  Use Blue Fire to melt away this barrier and go down the hallway
behind it.  Run down the hall to find - of all things - an old-fashioned block
pushing puzzle.

Kill all of the Ice Keese in this room before attempting to complete the
puzzle.  Unless you want things to be more difficult then they really need to
be.  While you're getting rid of the Keese, get the Gold Skulltula in the
corner (to your right as you come in from the GFSTIPD room) and take it's token
with the Hookshot.

To get out of this room, you have to gather all of the Silver Rupees around the
room.  None of them are hidden, the trick is in reaching them by using the
block of ice near the entrance to the room.  There is only one block, and
pushing the block off one of the cliffs in the room will cause it to respawn
back at the start of the room.

Go back to the ice block in the room, and grab it from it's east side and push
forward.  Now, climb on top of it, and use it to reach the silver rupee on top
of the tall stone block.  Go to the west side of the block, and push it east.
Get on top of it, and climb into the small alcove.  Use your remaining bottle
of Blue Fire to melt the Red Ice and take the Silver Rupee inside.  Drop back
down out of the alcove and push the ice block to the north or south and off the
cliff to make it respawn at the entrance to the room.

Now, grab the ice block from it's north side and push it south.  Jump onto the
ice block and use it to reach the silver rupee on top of the rock.  Now, grab
onto the east side of the stone block and push it to the west.  Climb on top of
the ice block, and grab the silver rupee on top of the stone.  Next, jump back
down, and get on the south side of the ice block.  Push it north.  Grab the
silver rupee from the stone that the ice block has to come rest on, and the
door will open.

Get on the ice block's east side and push it west, then get on it's north side
and push it south.  Climb onto the ice block and jump over to the Blue Fire.
Refill both of your empty bottles with Blue Fire.  If you want that bundle of
Red Rupees hanging high above the ground, then play the Song of Time here to
make a Block of Time appear, which you can then use.  Drop back down to the
ground, and push the block from it's west side going east.  Now, push it north
going south.  The block will collide with the wall, some distance away from the
door you were aiming for.  Jump up onto the block, and jump diagonally to the
doorway.  This isn't really the "legit" way to do it, but it's faster.

Run down the hallway, dodging more Stalactites and killing two more Freezzards.
Eventually, the hall dead ends on a line of Red Ice blocks which contain pots.
Use one of your bottles of Red Ice to open a path big enough to slip through.
Enter the door on the other side of the room.

In this room, you will fight the White Wolfos, which is just a larger version
of the standard Wolfos enemies.  Except that it's just as easy, and can be
defeated in exactly the same manner.  Allow the Wolfos to strike at you, then
backflip out of it's way at the last minute, then use a Jump Attack as soon as
you land.  Even with the Master Sword, it dies in one shot.

Once the White Wolfos is gone, then a chest will appear.  Open it to get the
Iron Boots, which let you walk underwater.  At this point, Sheik will appear
and teach your the Serenade of Water, which will take you right to the Water
Temple in Lake Hylia.  But we don't want to go there just yet.  In addition to
a Piece of Heart, we still need to get the Zora's Tunic from King Zora, which
lets us breathe underwater.  Which is cool.

Go around behind the chest to find a pool of water.  Equip the Iron Boots on
the Equipment Subscreen, and drop down into the pool.  The Iron Boots will drop
you down to the bottom of the pool.  Go through the door at the bottom.

You're now back in the first wide open room in the Ice Cavern.  Unequip the
Iron Boots and drop down off the cliff.  Head south (right as you land from the
cliff above) and go down the corridor.  Leave the Ice Cavern at the end of the
hall.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

----------------
Zora's Fountain
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP27]

As soon as you come out of the Ice Cavern, don your Iron Boots and drop down
into the pool of water.  Float to the bottom where you will find a Piece of
Heart.  Unequip the Iron Boots and float back to the surface, then head back to
Zora's Domain through the west entrance.

--------------
Zora's Domain
New Equipment: Zora Tunic

Use your last remaining bottle of Blue Fire on King Zora to unfreeze him.  Out
of gratitude, he will give you the Zora Tunic, which lets you breath
underwater.  In essence, it removes the Timer while underwater, much in the
same way that the Goron Tunic removes the timer while in super hot areas.  This
isn't really REQUIRED in the Water Temple (plenty of people complete the temple
without even being aware that the Zora Tunic even exists), but it helps take
the pressure off in some of the harder areas.  If you have an extra bottle of
Blue Fire, then you can use it to unfreeze the entrance to the Zora's Shop,
which sells extra Zora Tunics, in addition to other useless trinkets.

Now that King Zora is unfrozen, then I strongly recommend that you complete the
rest of the Biggoron Sword Trading Sequence in the appropriate Subchapter, if
you haven't already.  If you've been doing it as you progress through the game,
then do Parts VII through X now.  If you haven't done any of it (you lazy bum),
then I STRONGLY recommend you do the whole thing now.  It is very easy to
complete at this point in the game, and relatively quick (fifteen minutes,
tops, if you know exactly where you need to go).  Remember not to use any
transportation songs.  This means that you can't use the Serenade of Water when
you're delivering the Eyeball Frog, or the Bolero of Fire when you're
delivering the Eyedrops.  You have been warned...

I know you're probably itching to use the Serenade of Water to go straight to
Lake Hylia, but if you're willing to take the long way then we'll get a Piece
of Heart on the way.  Return to Hyrule Field via Zora's River.

-------------
Hyrule Field
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP28]

Hop on Epona, and ride her to an area northwest of Lon Lon Ranch.  The area in
question is a single golden tree, which stands alone northwest of Lon Lon Ranch
and slightly south of the river in northwest Hyrule (it's actually very near
Big Poe #09, if you've done the Big Poe Hunting sidequest yet).  Drop a bomb on
the tree's south side to open a pit.  Drop down the pit, and you'll find a deep
pool of water with a Piece of Heart at it's bottom.  Use the Iron Boots to sink
down and reach the Piece of Heart.  You can now submerge and play the Serenade
of Water to warp to Lake Hylia, though I recommend that you visit the Fairy
Fountain near the Forest Temple first to restock on Fairies.

-----------
Lake Hylia
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP29]

You've probably already been here before as Adult Link (I've directed you here
no less then twice previously in the guide), but in case you're just jumping in
the middle of the guide let me reiterate the astonishing fact: Lake Hylia is
now dried up!  Like, oh my god!

Okay, now that that's out of the way, head for the Observatory near the
southwestern shore of Lake Hylia.  If you planted the Magic Beans as a child,
then there will now be a Magic Leaf here that can be used ride to the roof of
the Observatory (alternatively, you can also use the Scarecrow's Song).  Once
on the roof of the Observatory, you can begin climbing the ladder to the top of
the high tower.  Your old friends from Lon Lon Ranch, the Guay's, return here
to harass you on your way up.  They may accost you on the way up, they may not.
It depends on chance, really.  On top of the tower is a Piece of Heart.

Once you have the Piece of Heart, drop back to the shore of the lake, and head
over to the Fishing Pond on the northeast shore.  Normally the Fishing Pond is
inaccessible until you've restored Lake Hylia, but with the help of the
Scarecrow's Song you can cheat a little bit.  Go to the northern edge of the
Fishing Pond's island, and Navi will flutter up and turn green.  Play the
Scarecrow's Song, and Pierre will appear.  Pull yourself up to him with the
Hookshot and enter the Fishing Pond.  If you don't have the Scarecrow's Song,
then you can also reach here using the Magic Leaf.

--------------------------
Lake Hylia - Fishing Pond
New Equipment: Gold Scale

I know what you're going to say: We've just gotten the Iron Boots, which let us
WALK underwater.  So why the hell are we coming here to get an item that lets
us dive deeper?  What the hell use is that?  Well, Mr. Impatient, the answer is
simple.  It lets you obtain another of the better hidden Pieces of Heart in the
game.  So next time, don't be so impertinent.  To those of you who weren't
going to say that, I register my apologies, and offer cookies as compensation.

The Fishing Pond is pretty much identical to last time, only the fish are
bigger.  So I'll just take the lazy route and cut and paste the paragraph from
the last time you were here, slightly modified to meet the new conditions and
rewards.

In order to win the Golden Scale, you have to capture a record breaking fish:
fifteen pounds.  There really isn't much advice that can be given for this.
It's all about patience.  Z-Target a fish, then hit B to cast.  Use the B
button, the A button and the joystick to play with the lure and attract fish to
the fly.  The biggest fish are found near the submerged log on the left side of
the pond and the reeds on the right.  Once a fish is on the line, hold down A
and pull backwards on the control stick to reel the fish in.  With that
information in hand, get fishing.

As a side note, I lied a little bit about this being pretty much identical to
last time.  The fish now are much larger and can therefore break free of the
line much easier.  There isn't much you can do about this.  If it happens, then
it happens.  The unfortunate downside to this is that once a fish breaks free
from the line, it disappears permanently.  If the pond starts running low on
larger fish, then leave it and re-enter, and they will respawn.  I find it also
helps to alternate between holding back and to the left, and back and to the
right every few seconds while you reel the fish in.

Once you have captured a fifteen-pound fish (minimum), return to the Clerk and
show him your fish.  He'll give you the Gold Scale.  Leave the Fishing Pond and
go to the Lake Hylia Observatory.  Enter it.

-------------------------
Lake Hylia - Observatory
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS072]
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP30]

There are two things to do in the Observatory involving your two new toys.
First, use the Gold Scale to dive down all the way down to the pool of water in
the corner of the room.  Speak with the scientist, and he will be so impressed,
he'll give you a Piece of Heart.  Next, equip your Iron Boots and sink to the
bottom of the pool of water.  Roll into the crate at the bottom of the pool to
reveal the game's only underwater Gold Skulltula.  Use the Hookshot to kill it
and take it's token.  Once you have these two items, return to Lake Hylia and
head for what's left of the lake beneath the large island in the southern area.

-----------
Lake Hylia

Equip the Iron Boots and use them to march into the small pool of water that
was once Lake Hylia.  Go to the north side of the island, and you will find a
door sealed by an iron grating.  Use the Hookshot to shoot the diamond switch
above the door, and the gate will unseal itself.  Enter the gate to begin the
next temple.

Welcome to the Water Temple, considered by more or less everyone to be the most
difficult Zelda dungeon... ever.  The thing that makes it hard is the dungeon
can be incredibly confusing when unguided.  Luckily, you have this guide, so
you're not unguided.  So don't be frightened, youngling.  The single most
mollifying thing about this dungeon is that, when one progresses improperly
through it, then they can literally get themselves permanently stuck and unable
to progress.  If you're worried about this happening, then you may want to make
a Copy of your game file before the Water Temple.  However, if you follow this
guide to the letter, then it won't be a problem.

Structurally, the Water Temple is actually very similar to the Deku Tree.  The
center of the dungeon consists of a tall room with many doors on it's three
different levels, a literal "Vertical Hallway."  The twist in this dungeon is
not trying to break through the three different levels of the dungeon, as in
the Deku Tree, but in trying to adjust the water level in the dungeon so that
you can reach certain doors on different levels of the Vertical Hallway.  This
concept is further twisted by the fact that you must enter certain areas of the
dungeon only after completing certain previous areas of the dungeon.  Finally,
after going up and down and up down more times then you care to count, you'll
be able to reach the final hallway at the top of the Vertical Hallway and
challenge the boss.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway
New Dungeon Item: Compass

As soon as you enter the dungeon, take off your Iron Boots (and equip your Zora
Tunic if you haven't yet) and climb out of the pool of water.  Run forward, and
kill the Tektite with an arrow or sword attacks.  Jump into the large pool of
water that fills the room, and swim to the passage visible on the right.  Climb
up onto the ledge and run down the hallway, going right around the corner and
into the pool of water.

Equip the Iron Boots and sink to the bottom of the pool.  Get used to changing
your shoes about fifty gazillion bazillion million and two times in this
dungeon.  Run down the hallway, and grab the stone block set in the wall
directly in front of you (the path goes left and right here, but ignore this
for now.  We'll get to it later on).  Grabbing the stone block, pull it back as
far as it will go.  Switch back to the Kokiri Boots and float back up to the
top of the pool.

Run back to the large pool in the center of the room.  The Tektites may have
returned; defeat them as necessary.  Jump into the larger pool of water, and
switch back to the Iron Boots.  Sink down to the passage directly beneath the
one you just came from, and go through it.  Switch back and forth between the
Kokiri and Iron Boots as necessary to reach your goal.

Run down the hallway, following it's winding path.  Your old friends the
Stingers from Jabu-Jabu's Belly reappear here.  The Hookshot is the only weapon
that can be used underwater.  And lucky you, the Hookshot can also defeat
Stingers in a single shot.  Once all of the Stingers are dead, run to the end
of the hall so that you are brushing against the large series of spikes set
into the ground.  Look up above the spikes to the ledge above them, and you
will see a Hookshot target.  Pull yourself up to the target with the Hookshot.
Turn around and look up to the ceiling, and you will see three more Hookshot
targets.  Pull yourself up to the one furthest away from you with the Hookshot,
and you will pull yourself out of the water.  Change back to the Kokiri Boots.

This room contains a pillar of water (similar to the pillars of flame from the
Fire Temple).  In the corner, there is a diamond switch.  Drop a bomb near the
switch, then run over to the pillar of water.  When the bomb explodes, the
switch will activate, temporarily lowering the pillar.  Open the chest to get
the Compass.  Put the Iron Boots back on and sink back down into the Stinger
Tunnel.  Return to the main room.

Back in the main room, use the Iron Boots to sink down to the bottom floor.  At
the bottom, you'll likely encounter several new enemies called Spikes.  To
defeat these, simply shoot them twice with the Hookshot; once to stun, once to
kill.  When you touch down on the bottom floor, enter the passage beneath the
one you just came from to get the Compass.  It is on the east side of the room,
marked by two torches (currently unlit thanks to that pesky water level).

Run down the tunnel's hall, and you'll meet Ruto again.  You may have forgotten
that you two are engaged to be married, but she sure hasn't.  Ruto will beg for
your help (don't worry, you don't have to cart her around like in Jabu Jabu's
Belly... in fact, you won't see her again until the dungeon is over).  Change
back to the Kokiri Boots to float up several floors.  On the way, you'll see a
huge gash in a wall which is an obvious bombable spot.  We'll get to it in a
while.  Once you have floated up two floors, you will reach an air pocket.

On the wall is a plaque inscribed with the Triforce.  Play Zelda's Lullaby, and
the water level in the dungeon will lower.  This switch lowers the water level
to the lowest level, and is therefore considered "Water Switch One."  Water
Switches Two and Three, respectively, raise the water to it's second highest
and highest depth.  We'll be using these switches throughout the dungeon to
access the different parts of the dungeon.

Once the water level is altered, go through the door to the left of the Water
Switch.

------------------------------
The Water Temple - Spike Room
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

This room is jam-packed with Spike enemies.  Defeat them with two Hookshot
attacks each, and a chest will appear.  Open it to get the Dungeon Map.  Map in
hand, return to the previous room.  If you're wondering just how Ruto managed
to disappear into thin air in this dead end... a wizard did it.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

Drop down to the bottom floor, to the room where you met Ruto.  Now that the
room is now longer flooded with water, then the torch has relit itself.  Before
you ask... a wizard.  Fire arrows through the torch onto the lanterns in the
corners of the room to unseal the door.  Break the pots in the room if you need
more arrows.  Go through the door.

------------------------------------
The Water Temple - Shell Blade Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Here, you introduced to a charming new enemy known as the Shell Blade.  Shell
Blades are invulnerable until just before they attack, when they briefly open
their mouth.  When they do this, fire the Hookshot into their open mouth to
kill it.  Watch out for flapping charge attack.

Defeat all of the Shell Blades, and a chest containing a Smell Key will appear.
Small Key in hand, return through the only door to the previous room.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS073]

Run down the hallway directly in front of you, and return to the main area of
the Vertical Hallway.  Now that you're back in the main room, head for the
south end of the room and go through the doorway there.  Go down the hallway,
and use a Bomb to blast through the strangely-colored tile on the floor at the
end of the hall, revealing a pit filled with water.  Switch to the Iron Boots
and sink to the bottom of the watery pit.

When you land, head to the west and defeat a Shell Blade with the Hookshot.
Hug the far wall, and change back to the Kokiri Boots to float up to the next
level.  On the next floor, climb up onto the ledge and step on the switch.  The
water level will rise slightly (in this room only), and a Hookshot target will
appear on the ledge above you.  Climb up to the next ledge, and use the
Hookshot to pull yourself up to the target.

Defeat the pair of Tektites, and then run to the grating against the far wall.
The switch to open the grating is actually just on the other side of it.  Use a
Super Spin Attack to reach it.  Kill the Gold Skulltula just on the other side
of the grating, and take it's token.  Take the contents of the pots, then head
back to the main room.

Run around the tower in the middle of the room and go to the west side of the
chamber.  Jump up onto the wooden platform, and grab hold of the stone block.
Push it forward until it falls down a pit filled with water.  Equip your Iron
Boots and sink down after it.

Turn to your right as you land, and run to the end of the hall.  Switch back to
the Kokiri Boots and float up.  Climb out of the water at the top of the
passage, and strike the diamond switch on the right.  A pillar of water will
rise from the pit in the middle of the room.  Jump out onto the pillar, and
then jump across to the other side of the pit before the time limit runs out.
If you fall, pull yourself back up using the Hookshot target.  Enter the door
on the other side of the pit.

----------------------------------
The Water Temple - Whirlpool Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

This room contains a pool of water which is being swirled around into a
whirlpool.  Equip your Iron Boots and drop down to the pool's bottom level.
Look in the mouth of the dragon's statue on the way down, and you will spot a
diamond switch.  To the right of the dragon statue, there is a small alcove
with a Hookshot target in it.  Pull yourself up to the alcove using the
Hookshot target, and then stand on the edge of the alcove, as far away from the
Dragon Statue as you can.  From here, you can just barely shoot the corner of
the diamond switch with the Hookshot.  Once the grating in the alcove is open,
go through it and kill the Shell Blades.  Stand against the far wall behind the
grating, and unequip your Kokiri Boots to float up to the next level.

Climb out of the pool and open the chest to get another Small Key.  This small
room contains another diamond switch, which reopens the grating below.  Strike
it, then sink back down before time runs out.  It helps if you equip the Iron
Boots before striking the diamond switch.  Back in the whirlpool, change back
to the Kokiri Boots and climb out of the water.  Return to the Vertical
Hallway.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

Pull yourself back across the pit using the Hookshot on the Hookshot target.
Return to the main area of the room by sinking down through the pool of water
with the Iron Boots, then using the Hookshot at the other end of the corridor
to pull yourself back up to the main room.

Go to the south side of the tower in the middle of the room, and you'll find a
locked door.  Go through it.

-------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Central Tower
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

When you enter the room, run to the opposite wall, turn around, look up and to
the right where there is a ledge.  Here, you will find a Hookshot target.  Use
it to pull yourself up to the ledge.  You'll find Water Switch Number Two here,
the switch that sets the water level it's second highest level.  Play Zelda's
Lullaby to move the water level up.  A passage will appear down below; equip
your Iron Boots and sink back down to the bottom level, and go down the
passage.

Run down the passage and around the corner into a small room.  Nail the switch
in the corner with the Hookshot, and a grating will open in the ceiling,
releasing six Spikes and three Shell Blades.  Defeat them all, and a grating
will open across from the diamond switch.  Change back to the Kokiri Boots and
float up the newly-opened passage.  At the top of the passage, get out of the
water and open the chest to get a Small Key.

Sink back down to the room below with the Iron Boots, and return to the area of
the tower with the Water Switch.  Float all the way back up to where the Water
Switch Number Two is, and enter the door across from the water switch.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway
New Dungeon Item: Small Key
It's now time to return to that gash in the wall, near where we met Ruto
earlier.  Change back to the Iron Boots, sink back to the bottom floor of the
room, and go down the east hallway on the bottom level.  When you reach the
room with the trio of unlit torches, change back to the Kokiri Boots and float
up one level.  Use Bombs to blow open the huge gash in the wall.  Enter the new
opening, and open the chest on the other side to get another Small Key.  Change
back to the Iron Boots and float down to the bottom level, and return to the
main room.

Back in the main room, switch back to the Kokiri Boots and float back up to the
second level, then go to the west side of the dungeon.  Enter the locked door
here.

-------------------------------------
The Water Temple - Water Pillar Room

This room contains a low water pillar and a diamond switch.  Stand on the water
pillar, and activate the diamond switch with the Hookshot or an arrow.  The
water pillar will rise, lifting you through the shaft in the ceiling.  Watch
out for the Tektite at the top of the shaft, who will attempt to knock you
down.  One of the easiest ways to kill it is to charge up a Super Spin Attack
while you ride up, and unleash it as soon as you see the Tektite.  Enter the
door at the top of the shaft.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

You've now found the final Water Switch, this one being Number Three, which
raises the water level to it's maximum height (coincidentally, the level it was
at when you first entered the dungeon).  Play Zelda's Lullaby in front of the
plaque to raise the water level again.  After the water level is raised, jump
down off the ledge and head for the west side of the room.  Go through the
locked door.

-----------------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Waterfall-Elevator Room

Kill the Keese on the left and right as you enter this room.  Run to the edge
of the cliff, and if you look to your right then you can see a Gold Skulltula
very high up on the wall.  You can't get it yet; you'll need a certain upgrade
to your "stretching, shrinking keepsake."

Hop off the cliff to a platform some distance below, and then hop off this
platform to the platform directly below it.  Look at the waterfall in front of
you, and you will see that the elevators which steadily descend from above all
have Hookshot targets on the front of them.  Reach the top of the waterfall by
latching onto an elevator, then pulling yourself progressively higher, until
you reach the top of the waterfall.  You have to be fast, as the elevators
descend at a slow but steady pace.

Once at the top of the elevator, go through the locked door.

------------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Dragon's Head Room

To progress through this room, you'll have to make the dragon's heads
throughout the room raise and lower by shooting the diamond switch in the
middle of the room, which will reveal a number of Hookshot targets.  Nail the
Diamond Switch once, then pull yourself over to the next dragon head with the
Hookshot.  Once on the other side, shoot the switch again to lower the dragon's
heads.  Run to the west side of the room, and use the Hookshot target on the
wall to pull yourself over.

Jump over the dragon's head, and shoot the diamond switch once more.  Pull
yourself over to the next dragon's head with the Hookshot, then hit the diamond
switch one more time.  Climb onto the lowered the dragon's head, then shoot the
diamond switch while you are standing on the head of the statue.  The head will
rise, letting you access the alcove on top of the room.

Kill both of the Tektites, then run to the far side of the alcove.  Defeat the
Like Like behind the large spikes by throwing bombs at it.  Use the Hookshot
target on the ceiling near the door to pull yourself over the spikes blocking
the path.  Go through the door on the other side.

-----------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Serene Pool

This room is famous.  For good reason.  For one, it looks great graphically.
For another, it features the return of Zelda II bad guy Dark Link.  Run to the
island in the middle of the area, and keep running around the island until Dark
Link appears near the tree.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Shadow Link

The first thing to know when fighting Shadow Link: do not perform a Stab attack
(forward + attack while Z-targeted).  It's tempting to use this attack a lot
(because let's face it, it works really well on most other enemies).  But
Shadow Link will just... well, you'll just have to see what he does.  In fact,
fighting Shadow Link with a Sword isn't really recommended at all.  Attacking
him with pretty much any basic sword attack will cause him to retaliate with
the exact same attack.  Pretend that Shadow Link and Hero Link's sword attacks
are magnets, each with the same polarity.  The same attacks will just deflect
one another.

So the trick is to use an attack with a negative polarity; i.e., an attack that
Dark Link can't perform.  This means using the Megaton Hammer.  He can't
deflect the Megaton Hammer.  He won't even try.  Just smack him around with it
until he dies.  Okay, a cool fight, but really easy and almost laughably
pointless.  If you're a combat purist and refuse to use such an easy tactic,
then the second-best way to beat him is to use regular sword attacks, but don't
Z-Target him.

After Shadow Link is defeated, then the pretty little pool will disappear and
the door on the north side of the room will unlock.  Go through it.

---------------------------------
The Water Temple - Longshot Room

Open the chest in front of you to get the Longshot.  This excellent little item
has double the range of the standard Hookshot.  Go around behind the chest to
find a Block of Time embedded in the floor.  Play the Song of Time to move it
out of the way, and drop down the pit on the other side.

----------------------------------
The Water Temple - The River Wild
New Dungeon Item: Small Key
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS074]

Navi, once again demonstrating her knack for the obvious, will warn you not to
get sucked down the whirlpools in this area.  Thanks for that, Sherlock.

Jump into the river of water, and ride it downstream.  Take it very slowly - in
addition to a Gold Skulltula we'd like to grab on the way, there are also a
Small Key.  It's also safer.  When you get near the whirlpools, strategically
switch back and forth between the Kokiri and Iron Boots to avoid getting sucked
in.  As you pass around the second corner in the river, you'll see the Gold
Skulltula hanging on the ceiling, directly above the third whirlpool.

Use the Iron Boots to come to a stop, and grab the Gold Skulltula and it's
token from the bottom of the river.  If you get sucked down past the fourth
whirlpool, then you can't backtrack.  So if you miss the Gold Skulltula and
pass the fourth whirlpool, then let yourself get sucked down and start over.
The game is extremely picky about when it will let you use the Longshot.  If
initially it won't let you use it even when you're using the Iron Boots, then
shift around slightly that you are COMPLETELY submerged.  Once you have the
Gold Skulltula, change back to the Kokiri Boots and keep swimming downstream.

Near the fifth whirlpool, right at the final corner of the river, there is a
small platform that you can climb up on.  Get on this platform and shoot the
golden eye switch with an arrow.  The grating across from the platform will
open.  Use the Longshot on the chest inside to pull yourself over before the
time limit runs out and the grating closes.  Open the chest for a Small Key.

Go to the right from the chest, and jump off the cliff on the other side to
find yourself back at...

----------------------------------
The Water Temple - Whirlpool Room

Climb out of the water to the alcove with the door.  Go out the door back to
the Vertical Hallway.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

Return to the main part of the Vertical Hallway (you've been here before, use
the same route you took the last time).  Once you're back in the main chamber,
float all the way back to the top floor and go back through the west door to
the Waterfall-Elevator Room.

-----------------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Waterfall-Elevator Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS075]

Kill the Keese on the left and right side of the room as you come in, then run
to the edge of the cliff.  Look on the wall to the right to see that pesky Gold
Skulltula that was just out of your reach last time.  Use the incredible reach
of the Longshot to kill it and steal it's token, then return to the Vertical
Hallway.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

We now need to move the water level back to it's second level, but to do that
we're first going to have move it to it's lowest level.  Equip the Iron Boots
and drop to the bottom level of the room, and go through the east hall back to
the room where you met Ruto.  Switch back to the Kokiri Boots and float all the
way up.  Play Zelda's Lullaby in front of the plaque to lower the water level
to it's bottom level.

Drop back down to the bottom floor, back to the room where you met Ruto.
Return to the main room of the Vertical Hallway, and make your way around to
the south side of the tower.  Enter the door into the tower.

-------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Central Tower
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS076]

Pull yourself up to the second level of the tower with the Longshot, and play
Zelda's Lullaby in front of the plaque to set the water level to it's middle
height.  Climb onto the floating platform, and look high up on the wall, near
the ceiling of the tower, where you will spot a Gold Skulltula.  Use the
Longshot to kill it and take it's token, then go out the door to the second
level of the Vertical Hallway.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

Work your way around to the south side of the tower's exterior, where you will
find a doorway which is covered by a grating.  Shoot the eye in the water with
an arrow (that pesky Wizard arrives again to help Link defy the laws of
physics) to make the grating open.  Use the Longshot on the Longshot target on
the wall behind the grating to beat the clock and access the hallway on the
other side.

Go east from the Longshot target, where you will find your path blocked by a
stone block.  Remember the very first thing that we did when we got to this
dungeon?  We pulled a stone block out of a wall?  Well, here's the continuation
of that puzzle, twenty minutes to an hour later!  Ain't this dungeon the
swellest?

Push the block forward until it stops, and then take a right down the passage
you just opened.  Open the chest to get a Small Key.  Now that you have the
Small Key, it's time to return the water level to it's highest point.  Turn
around from the chest, and go straight forward down the opposite passage
(ignore the passage going left).  Look up at the dead-end to see a Longshot
target.  Pull yourself up with the Longshot.  Go around the corner, and you'll
be back in the main room of the Vertical Hallway.

Drop back down to the second level of the dungeon, and enter the door on the
west side.

-----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Water Pillar Room

You know the drill here.  Ride the Water Pillar to the third floor, and go
through the door at the top.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

Play Zelda's Lullaby at the plaque to raise the water level back to it's
maximum height.  You're now done raising the water level.  In fact, you're done
almost playing around in this silly Vertical Hallway completely.  Chances are
you know it by heart by now.  You'll need to come back here fairly soon, so to
save time you may want to save your place here using Farore's Wind.

Equip your Iron Boots, and sink all the way back down to the bottom level
(yeah, that's right, back to the bottom floor).  Once on the bottom level, head
for the north end of the room to find a doorway which contains a deep pit.
Enter the pit and sink down with the continued help of the Iron Boots.  At the
end of the pit, go down a short hallway then change back to the Kokiri Boots to
float to the surface.  Climb up onto the ledge on the south side of the room.
Use the Longshot to pull yourself across the room, past the line of spikes.  Go
through the door on the other side.

----------------------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Not-As-Hard-As-It-Looks Room

You can do this room the easy way, or the hard way.

The easy way: Equip the Iron Boots and walk along the bottom of the pond,
watching out for Boulders.  Run to the northeast corner of the pond, and switch
back to the Kokiri Boots.  As you float to the surface, grab onto the ledge on
the north corner of the room and pull yourself up.

The hard way: Swim across with the Kokiri Boots, getting beat to hell in the
process.

Whichever route you pick, it's a whole lot easier if you eliminate the Tektites
with arrows first.  Once on the other side, go through the door.

------------------------------------
The Water Temple - Stone Block Room

Run forward, and jump off the edge of the cliff into the water below.  Equip
the Iron Boots and defeat all of the Stingers in the pool of water with the
Longshot.  Change back to the Kokiri Boots and climb up out of the pool.

There is a switch in the pool of water that will raise the water level in the
room, letting you access the west door, but we need to gain access to a block
hidden in the walls to activate the switch.  Bomb the walls in the northwest
and northeast corners of the room to reveal a hidden tunnel which contains a
stone block.  Facing north, enter the tunnel on the right to find a stone
block.  Push it to the west until it stops.  Run out of the tunnel and back
around to the other side of the tunnel, to the other opening that you bombed
open.

Grab onto the stone block here, and pull it backwards until you run out of
room.  Run back around through the tunnel you bombed open so that you are
behind the stone block.  Push it forward until it falls in the pool of water,
pressing down on the switch and permanently activating it.  The water level
will now rise.  Go to the west side of the room and climb up to the door.  Go
through it.

----------------------------------------------
The Water Temple - Water Pillar Triplets Room

Step on the switch in the corner, and three water pillars down in the pit will
rise, and the door across the room will unlock.  Quickly run and jump onto each
of these pillars, jumping to the other side of the pit.  Watch out for the
Tektites on the other side (performing a Jump Attack as you jump over to the
ledge can help defend against their attacks, but it's no guarantee).  If you
fall down or fail to reach the door before it locks, use the Longshot target to
return to the start and try again.  To make it across the fastest, only jump
out to the second water pillar, then jump straight for the door.  You don't
need to jump on the third one.  Go through the door on the other side when you
make it across.

----------------------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Not-As-Hard-As-It-Looks Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS077]

Run forward and into the passage of water (watch out for boulders that roll
along here).  Look to the right, and kill the Gold Skulltula on the wall.  Take
it's token, then use the Iron Boots to drop down the water pit beneath the
Skulltula.  At the bottom of the pit, go to the right and kill a Shell Blade in
the tunnel.  Switch to the Kokiri Boots, and float up to a locked door.  Open
the door.

-------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Boss Key Room
New Dungeon Item: Boss Key

Open the ornate chest to get the Boss Key.  Now you must return to the Vertical
Hallway.  If you saved your place there with Farore's Wind, then use the Wind
now to warp back there.  Otherwise, you'll have to take the long way back by
returning to the NAHAIL Room, following the water down into the pool of water,
and making your way back to the Vertical Hallway.

----------------------------------------
The Water Temple - The Vertical Hallway

Head to the top level of the room, and go to the north side of the tower.  Use
the Longshot on the dragon's head to pull yourself up, and go through the door
behind the statue.

-----------------------------------
The Water Temple - Blade Trap Room

This room contains a steep hill with three slow moving Blade Traps that strafe
slowly back and forth.  To get up the hill, you have to start climbing it using
the Kokiri Boots, and keep pressing forward.  If you have to stop at any time,
or if you get hit by the Blade Traps, then you will fall back to the start of
the ramp and have to start over.

Once at the top of the ramp, enter the Boss Door.

----------B-O-S-S-----------
Giant Aquatic Amoeba MORPHA
New Upgrade: Heart Container x1
New Quest Item: Water Medallion

I often hear this boss described as "hard."  I can only assume one of two
things: people assume that since the dungeon is fairly difficult and confusing,
then the boss must also be so.  The only other theory I can come up with (and
the one that I tend to favor) is that most people suck.  The only thing "hard"
about Morpha is it's ability to deal quite a large amount of damage in one
attack (which deal four to six hearts of damage... but since you should have
fourteen or fifteen heart containers by now, that's no big deal).

For the duration of this boss fight, it's very important that you avoid
entering the water, since this will give the boss easy opportunity to attack
you.  You should also avoid standing on the four platforms on the inside of the
room, since this will allow Morpha to attack you from several sides (this takes
more precedence later in the fight when Morpha has several arms to attack you
with), and also gives you very little room to move, making it even easier for
Morpha to grab you.  If you fall in the water or somehow end up on one of the
inner platforms, then get back to the perimeter of the room posthaste.  There
are ladders on the platforms in the middle of the room you can climb up if you
happen to fall in the water.

Morpha essentially has the same phase through the entire fight, where it will
attack you with it's arms.  The more damage the boss takes, the more arms
appear.  Morpha's "nucleus" (the large white brain/eye) will typically enter
one of these arms, and the arm will stretch out towards you.  If you make
contact with the arm, then it will grab you and hurl you into the wall.  Which
hurts about as much as you'd think it would.  Thankfully, your Longshot
outranges Morpha's arms by a considerable distance.  So stay a fair distance
away to avoid Morpha's only attack - it's arms.  You'll know Morpha is
generating another arm and is getting ready to attack when it spins around
rapidly in the water below.  After a while, it will spawn multiple arms.  These
arms rarely appear close enough together to box you in - unless, of course,
you're standing on the platforms in the middle of the room.  Which I already
told you to stay off of.

When Morpha enters one of it's arms, this is your opportunity to attack.  Grab
it with the Longshot, and it will remained stunned long enough for you to
attack it once, maybe twice.  Which is why you should make that attack a Jump
Attack with the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by now, no
excuses).  If you don't have the Biggoron's Sword, then a Jump Attack with the
Megaton Hammer will do.  After Morpha is damaged, it will bounce randomly
around the room for a little while, then return to the water and start spawning
more arms.  Continue attacking Morpha in this fashion until it dies.

Now if you're anything like me, you'll wonder how the hell people can find this
boss hard.  Take the Heart Container it leaves behind in the now-dried up pool,
then enter the beam of light to meet the Sage of Water: Ruto.  Ruto will give
you the Medallion of Water, and cancels your marriage plans (not that you had
any... hopefully.  I mean, come on, not only is she a snotty little drama
queen, she's also a fish).  Lake Hylia will now fill back up with water.  Ruto
will also mention that Zora's Domain will begin to unfreeze (in fact, if you
return to the waterfall outside Zora's Domain, it HAS stopped snowing).
However, there's nothing you can do to proactively unfreeze it.  We just know
it WILL happen, though it will occur well after the game is over.

-----------
Lake Hylia
New Item: Fire Arrows
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS078]

You can change back to the Kokiri Tunic or Goron Tunic at this point, if the
dark blue hue of the Zora Tunic isn't your thing.

After the cutscene upon finishing the Water Temple, you will find yourself back
on the island in the middle of Lake Hylia at sunrise.  This is convenient, as
there is an item that can be obtained at Lake Hylia only at this time of day.
Run to the east side of the island, where you will find a plaque set into the
ground.  If you read the plaque, then it reads,

"When water fills the lake, shoot for the morning light."

With the Water Temple finished, the Lake will be refilled.  So fire an arrow
directly into the sun, and the Fire Arrows will fall from the sky onto the
smaller island east of the larger one.  Swim out to it and take it.  It must be
at sunrise for this to work, so if you happen to be here at a different time of
day, then play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime, then hang around until the
sun rises (the Sun's Song makes it noon if you make it daytime, several
Hyrulean hours past when you can get the Fire Arrows).  You're going to need
the Fire Arrows later on in the Shadow Temple, which we'll get to after a brief
excursion back to childhood.

We're not quite done here yet.  Return to the larger island, and use the
Longshot to pull yourself up to the top of the dead tree.  It helps if you
stand to the left so that you can see the left side of the trunk, and pull
yourself up by aiming just above the large branch which sticks out near the top
of the tree.  Once you're at the top of the tree, make it nighttime to make a
Gold Skulltula appear on the top of the trunk.  Don't try to jump up and kill
it; just stand on the branch and use the Longshot.

Once you have the Token, play the Prelude of Light to return to the Temple of
Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

We'll head back to childhood in a moment.  For right now, return to Hyrule
Field and go to Kakariko Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village
New Song: Nocturne of Shadow

A cutscene will take place as you enter the village, whose awesomeness cannot
be described in mere words.  Afterwards, Sheik will teach you the Nocturne of
Shadow.  This transportation song is the ONLY way to reach the Shadow Temple.
Once you have learned the Nocturne of Shadow, head for Kakariko Graveyard.

-------------------
Kakariko Graveyard

Head for Dampe's Grave (it's the only gravestone with flowers on the left
aisle).  Pull it backwards to reveal a pit, and drop back down to Dampe's
Amazing Cave Race Game.

-------------------------------
Dampe's Amazing Cave Race Game
New Item: Piece of Heart x1 [HP31]

Before you ask, yes, you have done this before.  Except that last time, you
probably didn't win the Piece of Heart you get for finishing the race in under
1:00.  To accomplish this, you're going to have to follow the exact route you
followed before, only you'll have to roll the whole way (which is slightly
faster).  The other difference is, when you reach the last room (the large room
with the spiral ramp that rises up), use the Longshot from the bottom of the
room to pull yourself up to the door.

Here's the instructions on how to beat the race again, for your convenience:

Step forward a few feet to find the ghost of Dampe.  He will challenge you to a
race, and will start without notice.  Immediately run forward, dodging the
flames that Dampe drops (he'll drop them the entire race - keep an eye out for
them).  Turn right at the halls end, taking the corner tight to dodge a flame.
Turn left at the next corner, taking the turn wide to dodge another flame.

Run forward between the pair of flames, running along the left side of the gap.
Turn left and then right immediately on the other side, taking the turn wide to
dodge another flame.  Turn right, then left, then left again, taking the turn
tight.  Take another tight turn on the other side, and go through the door.

Take a right on the other side, and another right, and then a wide left.  Run
along the left or right side of the tunnel, then enter the wide room.  Go
through the door on the right.  Take a left, then a wide right, then through
another door.  Run to the wall on the other side, then a right, then a tight
left.

Jump onto the ledge to your left, and hug the left wall as you run forward to
dodge more flames.  Take a wide left, then a tight left to enter a tall room
with a large pit in the middle.  Use the Longshot to latch onto one of the
torches near the top of the room, and pull yourself up.  If you make it under
one minute, then Dampe will give you a Piece of Heart for your efforts.

Go through the door on the other side of the room, climb up the stairs and
you'll find yourself back in the Windmill.  If you still haven't learned the
Song of Storms from the Organ Grinder, then do so now by pulling out the
Ocarina in front of him.  Once you have both the Song of Storms and the
Nocturne of Shadow, return to the village and play the Prelude of Light to
return the Temple of Time and return to Link's Childhood.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

You should now be back as Young Link.  If you still haven't played all of the
basic songs for the Musical Frogs in Zora's River, and finished their minigame,
then do so now.  The two Pieces of Heart earned are more then worth it.

Once you're ready to continue on, play the Nocturne of Shadow.

-------------------
Kakariko Graveyard

Young Link can't do much in or around the Shadow Temple, so run west as you
warp in and jump over the fence to return to the lower area of the Graveyard,
then run out to the Village.

-----------------
Kakariko Village

Go into the Windmill and play the Organ Grinder the Song of Storms, and the
well outside will drain.  If it doesn't work, it's because you're still Adult
Link, numb skull.  Once the well is drained, go outside and drop to it's
bottom.  You'll find a passage at the bottom.  Go through it.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

This dungeon is really easy, and becomes even easier once you have the Lens of
Truth, the dungeon's big item.  This is because of the large number of fake
walls and floors, which can only be seen through with the Lens.  Luckily you
can get the Lens of Truth pretty much as soon as you arrive, and really the
only reason to stay in this dungeon is to get the three Gold Skulltulas who
reside here.  So that's what we'll focus on; the Lens of Truth, then the
Skulltulas.

----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Entrance

Run forward as you enter, and crawl through the small tunnel to it's other
side.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Reservoir

Drop down the cliff on the other side, and kill the Big Skulltula hanging from
the ceiling.  Since Young Link has neither the Bow nor the Longshot, you'll
have to switch back to the old method of kill it.  You'll reach an apparent
dead end, complete with a charming skeleton to emphasize the fact.  Just walk
forward, and you'll pass right through the wall to the other side.

While in this part of the room, you are in danger of falling down the numerous
pits which are hidden by fake floors, which are similar to the fake wall that
you just passed through.  To avoid these floors, stay in the shallow water the
circles the room as much as possible.  No pits appear in these tracks.  If you
do happen to fall down one of the pits, then head for the southwest corner of
the large room beneath the Reservoir, climb up the ladder and go through the
door at the top to return to the southwest corner of this room.  You'll need to
gather the Silver Rupees around the cess pool at the bottom of the ladder
before the door will open.

Jump across the pool of water directly in front of you and into the narrow
trench filled with water.  Remember this pool; we're going to be returning to
it in a moment.  Go left or right down the narrow trench, and follow it around
two corners (watch out for a gigantic green bubble who patrols the trench).
After the second corner, run halfway down the hall until you reach a point
where there is a Triforce painted on the floor of the trench.  Stand on this
symbol and play Zelda's Lullaby, and the water in the trench will drain away.

Return to the pool of water you passed near the entrance to the dungeon, which
has now become just an empty pit.  Drop down into the pit, and you'll find
another narrow crawlspace that Young Link can fit through, and a chest (which
contains bombs... exciting).  Go through the crawlspace.

------------------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Dead hand Hallway

Run forward, and kill the Big Skulltula that comes down.  Climb up the ivy-
colored wall to the next level and go through the door on the other end of the
room.

---------------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Deadhand Room
New Item: The Lens of Truth

When you enter the room, the door will seal behind you.  Notice the four giant
hands sticking out of the ground in the room.  Run near one, and it will grab
you, summoning Deadhand.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Deadhand

Deadhand is relatively basic, and follows an easy pattern.  Allow one of his
hands to grab you, and Deadhand's body and head will appear and move slowly
towards you.  Struggle free of the hand holding you by rotating the control
stick and slamming buttons, then Z-Target Deadhand's head.  Stand still (out of
the range of the hands), and wait for Deadhand to get near you, at which point
his head will lower to attack.  Execute a Jump Attack before Deadhand can
attack, and he will begin to run away, eventually sinking back into the ground.
Allow another hand to grab you, and repeat the process until Deadhand dies.

Once Deadhand has died, open the chest that appears to find the Lens of Truth.
The Lens makes invisible objects and enemies visible, and also reveals fake
walls and floors.  It steadily uses magic while activated, but there's a cool
trick you can use to avoid this: rapidly turn the Lens of Truth on and off by
tapping the assigned c-button, and it won't use any Magic Power.

If you like, use the Lens to look behind the chest, and you'll find another,
invisible chest which contains a huge rupee.  Lens of Truth in hand, return to
the main Reservoir room.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Reservoir
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x2
New Dungeon Item: Compass

If you don't care about Gold Skulltulas, then play the Prelude of Light to
return to the Temple of Time, and skip to the next chapter in the guide.
Otherwise, carry on from this point.

Climb out of the pit using the ivy on the opposite wall.  From the top of the
pit, run into the trench that was formerly filled with water.  Run to the left
towards the corner, and use the Lens of Truth to see an opening on the right.
Go through it and open the chest to get a Small Key.  Go back out in the hall
into the trench, and go around the corner.  Use the Lens of Truth to see
another opening on the right, which leads to a room with a chest.  Run into the
room, using the Lens to watch out for the large pit in the floor.  Open the Big
Chest to get the Compass, then return to the trench.

Go back down the trench in the opposite direction, back around the corner and
to the end of the hall.  Take a left around the corner.  Use the Lens of Truth
to find another opening on the left wall just around the corner.  Go inside to
find another Small Key, then return to the trench.

Run further down the hall, and use the Lens of Truth halfway down the hall to
see an opening on the left.  Go through it.  Immediately on the other side,
there is a locked door on the right.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Skulltula Room East
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS079]

Kill all four of the Keese in the room, then activate the Lens of Truth.
You'll see a narrow ledge on the right, going around the pit in the center of
the room.  Go along this ledge to the other side, where you will find a Gold
Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token with the Boomerang, then return to the
previous room.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Reservoir

Reactivate your Lens of Truth, then run to the right.  On the other side of
this small prison, there is another locked door.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Skulltula Room West
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS080]

Kill the Deku Baba in this room, and watch out for the pots.  They'll hurl
themselves at you, much like the tiles back in the Fire Temple.  Kill the Gold
Skulltula on the wall using the Boomerang and take it's token, then return to
the Reservoir.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Reservoir

Go right as you come out of the room, using the compass to see the opening in
the wall on the right.  Run down the hall directly across from this opening,
and drop down the cliff at the end of the hall.  Open the chest at the bottom
of the pit to get a Recovery Heart, then climb up the ivy wall.  Go through the
door at the top.

-------------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Coffin Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run into the room, and kill the Gibdos to the right.  Gibdos appear as mummies,
but are essentially the same as Redeads.  Once the Gibdos is dead, use the
torch near it to light a Deku Stick.  Run to the southwest corner of the room,
and light the torch next to the coffin in the corner.  The coffin will open,
revealing a Small Key.  All of the other coffins in the room contain unpleasant
surprises.

Once you have the Small Key, return to the Reservoir and climb back up to the
trench.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Reservoir

Turn left at the trench from the Coffin Room, and follow the trench around the
corner.  Run down to the end of this hall, to the northeast corner of the area.
Watch out for the pit near the wall here (use the Lens of Truth to dodge it).
Crawl through the crawlspace in the alcove in the northeast corner.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Tiny Room

Go to the right and through the locked door as you come out of the crawlspace.

----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Pit Room

This room contains a ton of flaming Keese, plus a Beamos enemy.  Haven't seen
one of them in a while.  Switch to the Hylian Shield if you're on the Deku.
Those Fire Keese can burn it to cinders in one hit.

Use the Lens of Truth to see the pits in the room, and carefully kill all of
the enemies in the room without falling down.  Use the Boomerang to defeat the
Fire Keese, and a bomb on the Beamos.  If your Deku Shield is burned, then the
chest in the corner contains another one.  Once everything in the room is dead,
carefully move to the northwest corner of the room, watching out for the pits
using the Lens of Truth.  Go through the door there.

-----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Reservoir
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS081]

Kill the Like Like by going kamikaze on it (at these close quarters you don't
have much choice), then kill the Gold Skulltula on the wall.  Take it's token.
We are yet to get the Dungeon Map, but if you don't care about that then use
the Prelude of Light to return to the Temple of Time and skip down to the next
chapter.  If you're a completionist, then return to the previous room.

----------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - Pit Room

Allow yourself to fall through one of the pits in the room.

---------------------------------------
The Bottom of the Well - The Cess Pool
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

Run south from where you land, and use the Bomb Flowers to blow the rocks
blocking your path to pieces.  Run south towards the green pool in the south
edge of the room, and take a left to pass down the tunnel flanked by a pair of
flaming torches.  Blow the rocks out of your way with a Bomb, then run to the
end of the hall.  Kill the Redead, then open the chest to get the Dungeon Map.
Finally done with this waste-of-time dungeon, play the Prelude of Light to
return to the Temple of Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

It's not quite time to return to adulthood yet.  Head out to Hyrule Castle
Market.

-----------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Market (nighttime)

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you have to, then head for the door
in the southeast corner of the area.  It's to the left of the Bombchu Bowling
Alley, near the entrance to the back alley.  Go through it.

------------------------------------
Hyrule Castle - Treasure Chest Game
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP32]

Speak with the clerk, and pay the fee to play the game.  He'll give you a Small
Key, which you can use to open the first door.  Go through it.  There are two
chests in this room, one of which contains a Small Key, the other of which
contains a Rupee.  The Key lets you progress, the rupee is a booby prize.
Normally, you'd have to guess which chest contains the Key.  But the Lens of
Truth makes things easier.  Simply use the Lens of Truth to see the contents of
each chest, and take the Small Key in each room.  When you reach the last room
in the minigame, you will find a lone chest which contains a Piece of Heart.

You can actually complete this minigame as soon as you access Hyrule Castle.
But the chances of making it all the way through the game without the Lens is
one in thirty two.  Which is three hundred and twenty rupees and several
tedious hours.  And that's not even a guarantee.  It could take LONGER.  Some
people might have that kind of patience, but I'm not one of them, and I'm
fairly positive most would agree with me.  So we got it now.  Return to the
Temple of Time and take the Master Sword to return to Adulthood.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

Back on Adult Link, play the Nocturne of Shadow to return to the outside of the
Shadow Temple.

-------------------
Kakariko Graveyard

Run east down the stairs near the warp point to reach a large room filled with
torches.  Stand on the pedestal in the middle of the torches and use Din's Fire
to light all of the torches (if you don't have Din's Fire, then return to
childhood and get it from the Great Fairy in Hyrule Castle Garden.  Also, you
suck).  All of the lit torches will open the door to the Shadow Temple.  Go
through it.

The Shadow Temple isn't so much a temple in that it is a giant obstacle course
of pits, blood-splattered guillotines, crushing ceilings, and other fun things
of a similarly deadly nature.  Some like this dungeon, some hate it.  No matter
how you look at it, it's easy, so don't stress out about it.  It's at least a
nice change of pace from the Water Temple.

-----------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Raven Room

Run forward as you enter the Shadow Temple, and look to the right around the
corner.  There is a long pit here, with a Longshot target on the other end.
Pull yourself across with the Longshot.  Run straight through the face carved
in the opposite wall into the next room.

This room has a large statue of a Raven, surrounded by several posts with
skulls on top of them.  Use the Lens of Truth on the posts, and find the post
which has the skull that does not disappear when exposed to the Lens.  Use the
handle on the front of the Raven statue to push it so that the Raven faces the
"real" Skull.  Don't stop pushing the statue until the Raven is facing the
proper skull, otherwise the floor will disappear and you will fall down.  Once
the Raven is facing the proper skull, the grating on the other side of the room
will open.  Unfortunately, there is a rather large pit in front of the grating,
which you can't cross.

Turn around and face the wall opposite the large pit, where you will see more
of those faces carved into the wall.  Use the Lens of Truth to find the fake
face on the right side of the wall.  Run through it, down the hall and through
the door at the other end.

------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Catacombs

The wall in front of you has a skull with blue, glowing eyes.  Keep this detail
in mind; all of the fake walls in this next area will have glowing blue eyes.
The skulls with flashing blue eyes have secret messages.

Run forward through the wall, and go right on the other side.  Run around the
corner, and use the Lens to see through a fake wall on the right.  Go through
the wall and through the door on the other side.

--------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Redead Room
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

Kill the Redead in the room, and then look high above to find two Keese.  Kill
them as well, and a Dungeon Map will appear.  Take the Map, then turn around
and go back into the Catacombs.

----------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Catacombs

Run back through the fake wall, and go right on the other side, then left
around the next corner.  Use the Lens of Truth to see through the wall flanked
by two pots, and go through it.  Run down the passage and through another fake
wall.  Go right and then left at the next corner, and use the lens to see
through the wall at the other end of the hall.  Go through the wall and through
the door on the other side.

----------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Deadhand Room
New Equipment: Hover Boots

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Deadhand

Another fight against another Deadhand.  It was easy with Young Link, but now
with Adult Link's superior offensive ability, the Deadhand will be a snap.
Remember, allow one of his hands to grab you, and Deadhand's body and head will
appear and move slowly towards you.  Struggle free of the hand holding you by
rotating the control stick and slamming buttons, then Z-Target Deadhand's head.
Stand still (out of the range of the hands), and wait for Deadhand to get near
you, at which point his head will lower to attack.  Execute a Jump Attack
before Deadhand can attack, and he will begin to run away, eventually sinking
back into the ground.  Allow another hand to grab you, and repeat the process
until Deadhand dies.  The Biggoron Sword can kill him in only a few hits.  The
only problem with the Biggoron's Sword is that Jump Attacks tend to fly right
past the Deadhand.  Go figure.

After the Deadhand dies, then a chest will appear in the room.  Open them to
get the Hover Boots, which let you walk on thin air for limited periods of
times.  Return through the Catacombs to the Raven Room.

-----------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Raven Room

Run forward through the fake wall, and then to the cliff.  Equip the Hover
Boots, and run out off the cliff to the ledge on the other side (it's carved in
the shape of a tongue).  Switch back to the Kokiri Boots and go through the
doorway.  Go down the tunnel on the other side.

Kill the Beamos by hurling a Bomb or two into it's head, then go to the wall on
the right.  It's actually fake.  Run through it and through the door on the
other side.

--------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Gibdos Room
New Dungeon Item: Compass

Kill the pair of Gibdos in this room (if you missed them in the Bottom of the
Well, Gibdos are more aggressive versions of Redeads).  A chest will appear
upon their demise.  Open it to get the Compass.  Return to the previous room.

-----------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Raven Room

Run forward back through the fake wall, and kill or dodge the Beamos.  Run
north and through the wall north of the Beamos - it's another fake.

--------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Scythe Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

This room contains a Scythe very similar to the one you encountered back in the
Ice Cavern.  And also like back in the Ice Cavern, this Scythe is only here to
make gathering the Silver Rupees in the room more difficult.  Run forward and
grab the two Silver Rupees which lie in the middle of the room, directly in the
Scythe's path.  You can roll under the Scythe's blades if you time it
correctly.  Now, run to the north wall, and use the Longshot to pull yourself
up to the Longshot target in the northwest corner.  Jump off the stack of wood
to grab another Silver Rupee.

Go to the alcove in the west wall and grab another Silver Rupee, then go to the
alcove in the northeast corner and grab another Silver Rupee.  The grating in
the southeast corner will open, revealing a chest.  Open it to get a Small Key,
then return through the door you came through in the south of the room.

-----------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Raven Room

Run back through the fake wall, the bomb the rough wall to the east.  The
barrier covering the passage behind it will be destroyed.  Run down the passage
and through the door on the other side.

---------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Guillotine Chamber

Run down the ramp in front of you, moving slowly to watch out for Big
Skulltulas hanging from the ceiling.  Eliminate them with the Longshot.  At the
bottom of the series of ramps there is a cliff.  Jump down off it.

In front of you are a series of gigantic guillotines that drop down from the
ceiling.  Run around each guillotine individually as they rise into the air.
Roll under them to move more quickly, if you're feeling nervous.  Watch out for
the Big Skulltula which hangs between the first and second guillotines.

Run around the corner, and Navi will warn you about Wall Masters in this area.
Run around in a circle, waiting for the Wall Master to appear, and kill it when
it drops down.  The last thing you need to be worrying about is a Wall Master's
untimely appearance in this next area.  Note that knocking the Wall Master off
the cliff doesn't count.  You have to actually kill it and see it burn on the
ground to work.

Jump out over the pit to the platform directly in front of the guillotines.
Wait for the guillotine to rise, then jump out to the next ledge just as the
guillotine begins to raise.  If you don't get moving as soon as it starts to
rise, then the blade will clip your backside as you jump over.  Repeat with the
next two guillotines, and watch out for a Red Bubble which jumps up from below
just before the third guillotine.

After the jump from the third guillotine, you will land on a small platform
where you will have to combat a Stalfos.  You haven't seen these guys since the
Forest Temple, but the method of fighting is still identical.  And easy.  The
only thing hard about this is the close quarters.  Remember to hold your shield
up and only attack immediately after the Stalfos does.

Once the Stalfos is out of the way, look to the east with the Lens of Truth to
see an invisible platform.  Jump out to it again, and jump once more to a
platform in the corner.  Still with the Lens of Truth on, look north and jump
along more invisible platforms until you reach a door.  Go through it.

------------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Invisible Scythe Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS082]

The name says it all.  This room has another gigantic scythe like the one you
faced previously, only this one is invisible.  You're going to want your Lens
of Truth activated at all times in this room, therefore.  Remember, if you
rapidly turn the Lens on and off, it doesn't consume magic.

Run around the corner and into the room, watching out for the giant invisible
scythe in the middle of the room.  Run to the back and kill the Like-Like, then
kill the Keese that dot the room with arrows.  Once you have killed the Like-
Like and the three Keese, then the grating in the rear of the room will open.
Go through it and kill the Gold Skulltula on the other side, as well as two
chests which contain a Blue Rupee and Arrows (use the Lens to see the second
chest).  Take the Gold Skulltula Token, then return to the Guillotine Chamber.

---------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Guillotine Chamber
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS083]
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Jump back across the invisible platforms to the platform where you fought the
Stalfos.  The Stalfos will appear again.  Fight him off, then jump west to the
rising and falling platforms.  Jump out to it as it falls.

Look to the right when you land on the rising/falling platform, and you'll see
a narrow cliff.  Jump out to this cliff when the rising/falling platform is
about halfway to it's apex.  Run southwest along the cliff, where you will
reach a wide platform which has a rotating set of Blade Traps and five Silver
Rupees.  Grab four of the Silver Rupees by running around the platform, dodging
the Blade Traps (there is a large gap between the pair that you can stand
safely in).  The last Silver Rupee is underneath the Beamos.  Blow it up with
bombs to reach it.

Once you have gathered all of the Silver Rupees, then the grating in the west
side of the platform will open.  Go through it and down the twisting hall, and
you'll come out in a large room with a number of crushing ceilings falling down
from above.  Just to make them more deadly, they're equipped with spikes too.

Use the Lens of Truth and look to the right wall as you enter this room, and
you'll see a stone block embedded in the wall.  Grab hold of the block and pull
it out until it lines up with the smiling face carved into the floor.  Now,
push the stone block forward until it prevents both of the crushing ceilings
from falling.  Move around to the other side of the stone block, and look to
the south where you will see an opening leading into one of the cells in the
room.  Go inside and kill the Gold Skulltula, and take it's token with the
Longshot.

Back outside the cell, grab onto the stone block and pull it backwards until it
stops. Jump up onto the top of the stone block, then to the platform on the
north side of the room.  Next, turn south and climb on top of one of the
crushing ceilings.  Use the ceiling as a bridge to reach the ledge on the south
side of the room.

Step on the switch on the south ledge, and a chest will appear on a ledge in
the northeast corner.  Hop onto the crushing ceiling just to the north of the
switch, and jump from the there to the ledge with the chest.  Open it to find a
Small Key.  Go back east to the main area of the Guillotine Chamber, run east
past the Blade Traps and onto the narrow ledge near the rising/falling
platform.

Head north along the narrow ledge, where you will reach another timed jump
involving a guillotine.  Use the Lens of Truth, and you will see the platform
on the other side of the guillotine.  Wait for the guillotine to begin to rise,
then jump to the platform.  Keeping the Lens of Truth on, look to the north to
see another platform, this once moving to the left and right.  Jump out to it
when it gets near enough, then jump to the ledge on the other side.  Go through
the door.

---------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Silver Rupee Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

The designers of the Shadow Temple REALLY liked Silver Rupee puzzles.

Getting the Silver Rupees in here looks easy enough, but don't be fooled; if
you use the Lens of Truth, you can see that most of the Silver Rupees are
conveniently placed right on top of invisible batches of spikes.  Most of the
Silver Rupees can only be reached by using the Longshot on the targets
throughout the room to pull yourself through the Rupees.

Start by killing both of the Redeads in the room, and then open the chest that
appears.  Keep your Lens of Truth activated to avoid the invisible spikes
around the room.  The chest contains a Blue Rupee.

Get the first Silver Rupee from the middle of the room, directly behind the set
of invisible spikes closest to the door.  Next pull yourself up to the Longshot
target on the east side of the room, and you'll fall onto a Silver Rupee on
your way down.  Now go to the west side of the room, where there is another
Longshot target, and a Silver Rupee suspended above the floor.  Pull yourself
up to this Longshot target, and you will grab the Silver Rupee on the way down.

The next Silver Rupee, which is directly behind you from when you land and
above a series of spikes, is a little more complicated then the previous ones.
If you look above the high ledge on the north wall with the Lens, then you'll
see an invisible Longshot target on the ceiling.  You have to pull yourself up
to this target, and pass through the Silver Rupee on the way to get it.  This
isn't hard, it just takes careful positioning.

The last Silver Rupee is on an invisible ledge in the northeast corner.  If you
use the Lens and look on the wall above the ledge, you will see another
invisible Longshot target.  Pull yourself up to this target, and grab the
Silver Rupee on the way down.  Now that you have all five Silver Rupees, the
door on the west side of the room will open.  Go through it.

-------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Skull Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS084]

This room contains a very large skull.  Climb to the top of the staircase on
the left or right, and you'll be above the skull.  When you get to the top,
kill the four Keese (two of them are in the other corners of the room, but will
attack you if they see you).  Once the Keese are out of the way, then toss a
bomb into the hollowed-out top of the Skull.  The Skull will explode, revealing
a key in the rubble.  Take the Key, and kill the Gold Skulltula for it's token,
then return to the previous room.  You have to kill all of the Keese in the
room before the door will unseal itself.

--------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Silver Rupee Room

Climb up to the platform on the north end of the room by using the Longshot on
the invisible target on the ceiling.  Go through the locked door.

---------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Fan Room

Run down the hall and around the corner, where you will find a pair of Blade
Traps and a fan at the end of the hall.  If the fan starts blowing, then it
will push you backwards (you can fight it by running into the wind), so wait
for it to stop blowing, then run past the Blade Traps.  If you equip the Iron
Boots, then the fan can't affect you (but you'll also move too slowly to get
past the Blade Traps, so stick with the Kokiri Boots).

Go around the corner and kill the Big Skulltula that hangs from the ceiling.
The fan in this hallway is more powerful, and DOES have the ability to push you
backwards, even if you fight it.  So use the Iron Boots to stabilize yourself,
and walk slowly around the corner, where you will find another fan and a large
pit.  Keeping the Iron Boots equipped, use the Longshot on the opposite ledge
above the pit to pull yourself across.  Drop off the cliff on the other side of
the pit.

Keeping the Iron Boots equipped, walk across the hall.  The Iron Boots will
keep the fans from blowing you off the cliff.  The Silver Eye above the door on
the other end of the hall will spit fire at you, so hold down the Z Button and
keep your shield up while walking forward to block the flames.  When you reach
the last fan on the right wall, change from the Iron Boots to the Hover Boots.
With the help of the Hover Boots, the fan will blow you through a fake wall on
the left and onto a ledge.  Go through the door on the other side of the wall.

------------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Other Gibdos Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Change back to the Kokiri Boots, then kill the Gibdos in this room while
dodging the Blade Traps on the floor, and a chest will appear.  Open it for a
Blue Rupee, then bomb the pile of rubble in the southeast corner of the room.
Use the Lens of Truth to see the chest beneath the rubble, and open it to get a
Small Key.  Use it to open the north door.

------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Cursed Boat
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS085]

This room contains a large river of fog, in which is set a large boat.

Look to the left as you enter the room to see a large stone block.  Grab it and
push/pull it along the track in the floor to the small trench near the ladder,
to the right of the door you came through.  Ignore the wire mesh ladder behind
the stone block; it leads back to an earlier area of the dungeon.

Climb up onto the stone block, and then up the ladder at it's top.  There's a
Triforce symbol on the floor here.  You probably know what to do with these by
now.  But first, go to the front of the boat, and look to the southwest.
You'll see an alcove with a Gold Skulltula in it.  You can use the Scarecrow's
Song to make Pierre appear up in that alcove, or you can just shoot the
Skulltula from the boat with the Longshot.  It's up to you.  Once you have the
token, return to the Boat and stand on the Triforce symbol.  Play Zelda's
Lullaby, and the boat will begin to move.

As the boat moves west, you'll have to fight off several waves of Stalfos.  You
can fight them if you like, or you can just take the chicken way out and block
all of their attacks until the boat nears the west shore, where they will
disappear.  Once the boat reaches the west side of the room, immediately jump
off the south side of the boat onto the shore.  Because the boat is going to
sink.

Once safely off the boat, head to the west side of the room and through the
door.

--------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Floor Master Room

This room appears to be a large, open room filled with Floor Masters.  In
actuality, this room is a simple rudimentary maze.  The catch is, the walls are
invisible.  Use the Lens of Truth to see the invisible walls.  Kill or avoid
the Floor Masters, and head to the north end of the room and go through the
door.

----------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Crushing Walls Room
New Dungeon Item: Boss Key

This room contains two walls, each covered with spikes, both of which are
crushing towards you.  This would be a problem, except for the fact that both
of the walls are made of wood.  Use Din's Fire to burn them both.  Go to the
east side of the room, and kill the Redead.  Open the ornate chest to get the
Boss Key.  The chest on the west side of the room contains a Blue Rupee.

Once you have the Boss Key, return to the previous room.

--------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Floor Master Room

Make your way around the invisible walls to the south side of the room, and go
through the door there.  Once again, fight or ignore the Floor Masters on the
way.

------------------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Invisible Floor Master Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

This room contains an invisible Floor Master.  Use the Lens of Truth to see it.
Once you defeat it, it will split into three midget Floor Masters (who are also
invisible), which will grow full size if you don't kill them quickly.  Use
Din's Fire to quickly kill all three.  Once the Floor Master and his spawn are
dead, a chest appears in the rear of the room.  Open it to get a Small Key,
then return to the previous room.

--------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Floor Master Room

Make your way around the invisible walls to the west side of the room, and go
through the door there.  Once again, fight or ignore the Floor Masters on the
way.

--------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Triple Skull Room
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS086]

This room is similar to the Skull Room you passed previously, but has three
rotating Skulls in it.  You don't actually have to destroy any of them, unless
you want lots of rupees.  Nail the Gold Skulltula on the wall behind the
Skulls, take it's token, then return to the previous room.

--------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Floor Master Room

Make your way around the invisible walls to the east side of the room, and go
through the door there.  Once again, fight or ignore the Floor Masters on the
way.

------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - The Cursed Boat

On the south side of this area there is a large pit which even the Hover Boots
can't get you over.  On the left side of the ledge opposite the pit, there is a
tall pillar which is surrounded by bomb flowers.  Nail one of the bomb flowers
with a Fire Arrow, and the pillar will fall down, making a bridge leading
across the gap.  Cross the bridge, and go through the door in the south side of
the room (the two platforms on the east side of the room can be reached with
the Song of Time and the Scarecrow's Song, but they contain only recovery
hearts).

-----------------------------------------
The Shadow Temple - Geometric Shape Room

Equip the Hover Boots and use the Lens of Truth to see the platforms in this
room.  Run out to the T-Shaped platform directly in front of the door, then go
to the left to the straight platform.  From there, go right to the next
platform, and then to the ledge with the Boss Door.  Go through it.

-------------B-O-S-S-------------
Phantom Shadow Beast BONGO BONGO
New Upgrade: Heart Container x1
New Quest Item: Shadow Medallion

Pure evil has a name.  And that name is: Bongo Bongo.  Drop down the pit in the
middle of the room to begin the fight.

The entire boss fight is fought on a giant drum.  A giant Bongo Drum.  Yep,
that's right.  Bongo Bongo will attack you with his hands, or try to knock you
off the drum by pounding it hard.  Just use basic dodging to avoid these
attacks.  There's really no trick to it.  Just make sure you're using the
Kokiri Boots, otherwise this fight will be unnecessarily difficult.

To damage Bongo Bongo, you must make his eye appear.  To do this, shoot both of
his hands with arrows to stun them.  They recover quickly, so shoot fast.  Use
Z-Targeting; the hands move much too fast, and the constant movement of the
drum makes manual aiming pretty much impossible.  Once you stun both hands, use
the Lens of Truth to look at the space between the hands, and you'll see Bongo
Bongo's eye.  Shoot it with an Arrow as well, and Bongo Bongo's torso will fall
to the floor, letting you attack it.  As always, that attack should be a Jump
Attack from the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by now).  The
boss fight then resets.  Repeat until Bongo Bongo dies.  If you run low on
magic or arrows, Bongo Bongo's hands drop more when you stun them.

Yeah, that boss was easy.  But he was just bizarre enough for it not to matter.
Take the Heart Container that Bongo Bongo leaves behind, then enter the beam of
light to meet the Sage of Shadow: Impa (who ran into the Shadow Temple ahead of
you, and was captured long before you even entered the dungeon).  As a last
request, Impa will request that you "Look out for the Princess."  If you've
been wondering where she is, or you somehow managed to live through the year
1997 and not hear the spoiler, then just know that you're close to finding out.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

This part of the guide can be finished immediately after obtaining the Bow and
Epona, so you may have finished it already.  If you have, then head for the
Haunted Wasteland through the gate in the northwest corner of the Gerudo
Fortress immediately.  Otherwise, proceed from this point.

-------------------
Kakariko Graveyard

After you warp back here from the Chamber of the Sages, then head for Hyrule
Field and go to Gerudo Valley, in the west side of the Field.

--------------------------
Gerudo Valley (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x2 [GS087] [GS088]

Go up the log bridge near the entrance of the Valley, and when you reach the
fallen bridge spanning the canyon, either use Epona to jump over the gap or the
Longshot to pull yourself over.  If you speak with the Carpenter on the other
side of the canyon, he'll report that he came to the Valley to repair the
bridge.  But, his assistants ran off to join the Gerudo Thieves, and were
captured.  Rescuing the Carpenters and getting the bridge repaired may seem
trivial, but you're going to have to do it to progress anyway.

Head around to the backside of the Carpenter's Tent, and make it nighttime.
There is a Gold Skulltula on the wall behind the Tent.  Kill it and take it's
token with the Longshot.  Head south to the wall opposite the tent, where there
is an arch formed from the natural stone.  Look on the back of the arch to see
another Gold Skulltula (it has to be nighttime).  Kill the Skulltula and take
it's token with the Longshot.

After you have both of the Skulltula Tokens, go west through the valley and
through the pass on the west side.

------------------
Gerudo's Fortress

The Gerudo Thieves will give you a similar greeting that they gave the
Carpenters... if they see you, they'll throw you into a prison.  Run north from
the entrance to the fortress until you reach a stairset on the right.  Climb up
the stairs, where you will find purple-suited Gerudos patrolling the area.
Allow one of them to see you, and you will be thrown into a prison.

If you are ever seen by a guard in the Fortress, then you will be sent back
here.  Look south in the prison cell, and look high on the wall to find a
window.  Pull yourself up to the window by shooting the wooden awning with the
Longshot.  Standing on the window sill, look far down below to see the
patrolling Gerudos who threw you in prison.  Also, to the left there is a
doorway.  Stun the Gerudo closest to this door with an arrow (you can use the
Longshot if you run out of arrows, but it doesn't stun the guards for nearly as
long), then quickly jump down from the window sill and into the door before the
Gerudo recovers.

---------------------------------
Thieves' Hideout - Ichiro's Cell
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run around the corner to find the first of the captured Carpenters, Ichiro.
Speak with him through the cell bars, and you'll be attacked by a Gerudo
Thieves.  Fighting Gerudo Thieves is actually a lot like fighting a Stalfos,
but they are much faster.  Attack them immediately after they attack you, but
watch out for the Gerudo's Stun Attack.  You'll know that the Gerudo is going
to do this when she crouches slightly and holds her swords far apart.  If you
get hit by this attack, you will instantly lose the fight and return to the
prison cell back in the Fortress.  If you're not very good at swordplay, then
arrows work extremely well, but it takes a lot of them to defeat a Thief.

Once the Gerudo Thief is defeated, take the Small Key she leaves behind and
open Ichiro's cell.  Run inside and speak with him to free him.  Go back
outside his cell and head to the left, and out the door there.

------------------
Gerudo's Fortress

There is a door to the east as you come out of Ichiro's Cell.  Go through it
now.

-------------------------------
Thieves' Hideout - The Kitchen

Head up the ramp and go right.  Run down the hall until you reach a passage
leading to the right, and go down it.

------------------
Gerudo's Fortress

Run towards the corner of the roof that you come out on, and stop before you go
all the way around the corner.  Peek around the corner using the Z-Focus
maneuver you learned back in Sacred Forest Meadow, and you'll see a patrolling
Gerudo Guard.  Wait for her to face away from you, then nail her in the back
with an arrow.  Run around the corner, jump up the ledge and go through the
door on the right.

----------------------------------
Thieves' Hideout - Sabooro's Cell
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

Run up to the top of the ramp, and speak with Sabooro in his cell at the far
end of the room (the closer cell contains pots, which contain junk).  Defeat
the Gerudo Thief that appears, and then open Sabooro's Cell.  Speak with him
again to free him, then head back out of the cell.  Head to the right and up
around the corner, and through the doorway there.

------------------
Gerudo's Fortress

There is a door to the left as you come out of the door leading to Sabooro's
Cell.  Go through it.

-------------------------------
Thieves' Hideout - The Kitchen

You're now in the large room at the end of the hall, which we passed on our
last visit here.  From the doorway, look to the right and down the ramp to see
a pair of guards.  Shoot both of the guards in the room with arrow to stun
them, then equip the Hover Boots.  Use them to run out to the ledge directly in
front of you from the doorway.  From the ledge, run across to the ramp on the
other side of the kitchen.  Change back to the Kokiri Boots, then go around the
corner and through the doorway.

------------------------------
Gerudo's Fortress (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP33]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS089]

If it isn't nighttime when you return to Gerudo's Fortress, then play the Sun's
Song to make it so.  As you come out of the door, look to the south and jump up
the ledge to the next roof.  Run along the roof until you reach it's end, then
face the west.  Jump over the gap here to the adjacent roof, then around the
corner to find a wall covered with ivy.  Climb the ivy to the top level of the
Fortress.

Run around the roof, following the wall so that you are eventually running back
north.  When you reach the north end of the roof, you will see an adjacent roof
with a chest sitting on it.  If it's nighttime, then you will also see a Gold
Skulltula clinging to the wall on the east side.  Use the Longshot to kill it
and take it's token.  The gap between the roofs is too far to jump, so use the
Longshot on the chest to pull yourself over to it (the Longshot's range is just
barely far enough to reach it).  Alternatively, you can also use the
Scarecrow's Song to make Pierre appear, presenting a closer target.

Open the chest to get a Piece of Heart, then play the Sun's Song to warp back
to the doorway from the Kitchen.  Back at the door, look to the north where
there is a small jump down to a ledge below, which contains a single door.
Drop down to this ledge and go through the doorway.

-------------------------------
Thieves' Hideout - Jiro's Cell
New Dungeon Item: Small Key

As soon as you enter, pull out your Bow and stand still.  Wait for the Guard to
appear from around the corner, and nail her before she can see you.  Run around
the corner and to the right, then left at the next corner.  Run down the hall,
and around another corner to reach another cell at a dead end.  Speak with
Jiro, and defeat the next Gerdo Thief that appears.

Take the Small Key that the Gerudo Thief leaves behind, then open the Jiro's
Cell.  Speak with him, and he'll escape.  Head back out the same way you came
in, and watch out for the Gerudo Thief near the entrance (who may be unstunned
by now).

------------------
Gerudo's Fortress

As you come out of the door from Jiro's Cell, look to the west and drop off the
cliff to the roof below.  There is a door on the right as you land on this
level of the rooftop.  Go through it.

--------------------------------
Thieves' Hideout - Shiro's Cell
New Dungeon Item: Small Key
New Quest Item: Gerudo's Membership Card

Run down the hall and around the corner, where you will find the last
Carpenter, Shiro, locked in his cell.  Speak with him, and defeat the Gerudo
Thief that appears.  Use the Small Key that the Thief drops to open Shiro's
cell, then run inside and speak with him to free him.  After Shiro is freed, a
Gerudo Lieutenant will appear and speak with you.  She is so impressed by your
abilities to sneak around the Fortress, that she'll make you an Honorary Gerudo
Thief, and present you with a Gerudo Membership Card.

This Card does many things.  For one, it lets you move around Gerudo Fortress
freely without the guards harassing you.  It also lets you access the Gerudo
Training Ground and the Horseback Archery Range, letting you win the Ice Arrows
(Gerudo Training Ground), the Biggest Quiver, and a Piece of Heart (both from
the Horseback Archery Range).  The Card's most important function, however, is
that it lets Link open the gate in the northwest end of the Fortress, letting
him access the Haunted Wasteland, the Desert Colossus and the Spirit Temple.
Also, the bridge back in Gerudo Valley is now repaired.  Whoopee.

Now that you're an official Gerudo, then head back out to the Fortress.

------------------------------
Gerudo's Fortress (nighttime)
New Upgrade: Arrow Quiver x50, Piece of Heart x1 [HP34]
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS090]

You can move on with the game now if you like, if another Gold Skulltula and
several upgrades don't interest you.  To open the gate in the northwest corner
of the Fortress by climbing to the top of the tower and speaking with the
Gerudo there.  Then, skip down to the next chapter.  Otherwise, carry on from
this point.

Make sure it's nighttime before progressing from here.

From this point on, you can complete the Gerudo's Training Ground at any time.
It's in the southeast corner of the Fortress.  Speak with the guard out front
of the door blocked by a metal grating, pay the entrance fee and she'll let you
inside.  You can complete the Training Ground and get the Ice Arrows now, but
you won't be able to finish every room in the Training Ground without the
Silver Gauntlets from the Spirit Temple.  If you're going to do the Training
Ground now, then move on down to the chapter on the Training Ground.

Whether you choose to do the Training Ground or not, you at least want to do
the highly lucrative (but very challenging) Horseback Archery Range.  You're
going to need Epona up here, so use Epona's Song to summon her if you need to.
If you do have to use the Song to summon her, then she'll appear near the south
entrance to the Fortress, near the entrance from the Valley.  If you don't have
Epona, then don't fret; the Gerudo's will sportingly let you borrow one of
their horses for the Shooting Range.

On Epona, ride up the passage that leads east to reach the massive Horseback
Archery Range.  If you're after the Gold Skulltula here, then it's high on the
target on the north side of the area.  Use the Longshot to kill it and take
it's token, then return to the awning near the south side of the gallery.
Speak with the Gerudo dressed in white beneath the awning (she only appears
during the daytime, so use the Sun's Song if you need to), and pay her the fee
to play the game.  You must be riding Epona before you speak to her (unless you
don't have Epona, in which case you just speak to her on foot).

The Gerudo Archery Range is by far the hardest shooting range in the game,
though if you managed to do the Big Poe Hunting sidequest then it shouldn't be
much of a problem.  You get twenty arrows to use, and in order to win the Piece
of Heart from this game you must score at least 1,000 points.  There are huge
wooden targets set up along the course as well pots that appear on the way.
Shoot the pots for 100 points each, and the targets are worth varying amounts
depending upon how close to the center you are (the exact middle of the target
is worth 100 points).

Epona will automatically run up and down the course (you get one pass in each
direction before the game ends).  On your first pass, focus on hitting the pots
as you pass by them.  Once you nail all the pots, focus on the target on the
far north side of the course.  On your second pass, shoot for the targets on
the east side of the course until you get near enough to accurately hit the
target on the south side of the course.  Once you do get near enough, aim for
it.

Once you score 1,000 points, you'll win the Piece of Heart.  Play the game
again and score at least 1,500 to earn the Quiver.  If you score 1,500 or more
on your first attempt, then you have to play again to earn the Quiver and
repeat the feat.  Sorry, that's just how it works.  You don't get anything for
scoring a perfect 2,000, aside from a hearty pat on the back.

Once you have the Biggest Quiver, the Piece of Heart, and the Ice Arrows (if
you choose), then head for the northwest corner of the Fortress and climb to
the top of the tower there.  Speak with the Gerudo at the top, and she'll open
the gate for you.  Run through the gate and into the desert to enter the
Haunted Wasteland.

The Haunted Wasteland
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS091]

The Haunted Wasteland is a short obstacle course, requiring you to cross the
desert to reach the Desert Colossus.  On the way, you will be challenged to
complete a series of goals.

To begin with, you will appear between a pair of flags.  Run forward through
the flags, and past the crate until you reach a large gap filled with sinking
sand.  Use the Longshot on the crate on the other side of the gap to pull
yourself over.

Start running to the next flag you can see to the northwest, and continue in a
similar fashion from flag to flag.  If you stray too far from a flag, then you
will be warped back to the start of the Wasteland.  If you can't see where the
next flag is, then you can play the Song of Storms.  The lightning caused by
the storm will briefly light up the horizon, revealing the next flag.  After
the second flag in the series, you will reach a sign which points you to the
Carpet Merchant.  Follow the sign to the Merchant if you like, but all he sells
is Bombchus.

At the end of the path of flags, you will reach a large stone structure
surrounded by a circle of red flags.  Near the south side of the structure is
an opening.  Go through it, and drop down the cliff to it's bottom.  Kill the
Gold Skulltula at the bottom of the pit, and take it's token with the Longshot.
If you light both of the torches with Din's Fire or Fire Arrows, then a chest
containing a Purple Rupee will appear.  Once you have the Gold Skulltula and
it's token, climb back up to the surface using the ladder on the south side of
the room.

Back on the Haunted Wasteland, climb to the top of the structure using the ramp
that begins on the north side of the structure.  At the top, there is a
monument which reads "One with the EYE OF TRUTH shall be guided to the Spirit
Temple by an inviting ghost."

Standing on top of the structure and facing north, turn on the Lens of Truth to
see a ghost.  Keep the Lens activate whiled following the ghost; if you use the
tapping trick which prevents the Lens from using magic power, you can easily
lose track of the ghost.  Follow the ghost on it's winding path through the
desert, and you will eventually see a pair of flags.  You'll know you're
getting close when Leevers start coming out of the ground to harass you.  Dodge
out of the way of the Leevers by rolling forward, and head towards the flags
when you see them.  From the pair of double flags, you'll see another flag to
the west.  Run towards it to enter the Desert Colossus.

----------------------------
Desert Colossus (nighttime)

This area is crawling with Guays and Leevers, all of which you should ignore
(unless you like torturing yourself, you silly masochist you).  The Leevers
can't be Z-Targeted, and are a pain to kill.  I don't even try.  The Leevers
are weak and can only appear in the sand, so if you run quickly to any part of
the ground that isn't sand then you're safe from them.  Head for the pair of
trees to your right as you enter from the Haunted Wasteland.  There is a crack
in the wall between the two trees.  Use a bomb to blow it open, then enter the
doorway you created.

-----------------------
Great Fairy's Fountain
New Item: Nayru's Love

Run into the fountain and stand on the Triforce symbol.  Play Zelda's Lullaby,
and the Great Fairy of Sexual Dominance will appear to give you Nayru's Love,
the final magic spell in the game.  By far the most useful of the three,
Nayru's Love makes you invulnerable to all damage.  There are a few points in
the game where this comes in great handy, several of which are coming up in the
near future.  The only downside to Nayru's Love is it uses one-quarter of your
magic bar to cast (half of it if you haven't gotten the Magic Bar Upgrade).

Once you have Nayru's Love, go back out to Desert Colossus.

----------------------------
Desert Colossus (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS092]

If it still isn't nighttime, then make it so now.  Head for the dried up oasis
in the south of the area.  If you stand on the pile of flat rocks near the
oasis and play the Song of Storms, then the oasis will be refilled with water
and becomes a Fairy Fountain.  A Fairy Fountain right outside a temple!  How
useful!

On one of the palm trees near the Oasis is a Gold Skulltula.  It's near the
top, near the fronds.  Kill it and take it's token with the Longshot.  The
Leevers will probably give you a hard time; if you stand in the shallows of the
water then you can fire the Longshot undisturbed, but you'll have to move
around to the front of the tree to actually get the Token, putting you back in
range of the Leevers.

Now head for the Colossus itself, the huge stone statue in the west corner of
the area.  Enter the small door at it's base.

-----------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Entrance

Surprise!  You can't do anything here!  Oh noes!  What are we going to do?
Turn right back around and return to the Colossus.

----------------
Desert Colossus
New Song: Requiem of Spirit

Sheik will appear in front of you, and make some cryptic remark about using the
Master Sword as a boat to sail on the rivers of time, and using the song to
reach the Desert as a Child.  Play the Prelude of Light to return to the Temple
of Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time

Replace the Master Sword to return to Link's Childhood.  Back as Young Link,
play the Requiem of Spirit to warp back to the Desert Colossus.

----------------
Desert Colossus
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS093]

Head for the entrance to the Spirit Temple.  To the left of the door there is
the game's final patch of soft earth.  Drop a Bottled Bug in the patch to make
a Skulltula appear, and don't bother recapturing one of the bugs - you won't
need them anymore.  Kill the Skulltula and take it's token.  If you need a new
Bug, then they can be found underneath a rock north of the Oasis.  Speaking of
the Oasis, you can go there and play the Song of Storms to make the Fairy
Fountain appear again.  Plant your final Magic Bean in the patch of soft earth,
then head into the temple.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Optional Dungeon: The Gerudo Training Ground (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Four)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

The Spirit Temple is unique in that it is the only dungeon which requires both
Young Link and Adult Link to finish (with the possible exception of Dodongo's
Cavern, which contains a Skulltula only obtainable with Adult Link).  The
Temple is divided into two wings: The West Wing, and the East Wing.  The West
Wing is smaller, and is largely Young Link's territory.  The East Wing is much
larger, and is Adult Link's stomping grounds.  The Spirit Temple also contains
two Dungeon Items, one each for Young Link and Adult Link (though Adult Link is
the only person who can use either of them).  For Part I of the Spirit Temple,
we are dealing with Young Link in the West Wing.

-----------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Entrance

Young Link is going to face a lot more fire-based enemies here, so change back
to the Hylian Shield if you're use the Deku Shield.

Adult Link couldn't accomplish much here, but Young Link is a different story.
As you enter, run up the stairs, watching out for the pair of pots that come
flying at you.  At the top of the stairs, go to the left to find a Gerudo Thief
trying to crawl into a hole that is far too small for her.  This is Nabooru,
the second-in-command to Ganondorf that heard so many unpleasant things about
as an adult.  Speak with her, and she won't seem so nasty - quite the opposite,
in fact.  Tell her "Nothing, really." when she asks what you're up to.  Past
that, she'll ask you more questions, but it doesn't matter what your answers
are.  Nabooru will ask  you to help her to - of all things - fight Ganondorf.
What exactly happens to her in the next seven years that makes her Ganondorf's
loyal, fearsome second is something you'll find out in a little while.

Once Nabooru moves aside, crawl through the crawlspace yourself.

--------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Armos Knight Room

If you still haven't switched back to the Hylian Shield, then do so now.

Run forward, dodging the Blade Trap, and kill the Fire Keese who try to attack
you.  Run up the stairs and to the right, and you'll see an Armos Knight being
circled by a Blade Trap.  Drop a bomb next to the Knight, and attack him with
the sword just before the bomb explodes.  The explosion will then defeat the
Knight.  If you screw up, use Bombchus to defeat him.  Next, use a Boomerang to
kill the Keese on the wall behind the Armos, just above another crawlspace.

Once you have killed all of the enemies in the room, the doors in the room will
unseal themselves.  Go through the door to the left of the crawlspace.

---------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Stalfos Room

Run forward, and ten-year-old Link will have to fight a Stalfos.  These guys
were massive to Adult Link; now you're less then one-quarter it's size.  Don't
let the size difference alter your strategy.  Dodge the Stalfos' attacks, and
attack immediately after he does.  If you're unsure of your ability to beat it,
then use Nayru's Love before the fight begins.

Once you have beaten the Stalfos, face the pit with the Green Bubble floating
around in it.  Stun the Bubble with the Boomerang, and defeat it with a
Slingshot attack.  You must now use the Boomerang to hit the Crystal Switch
behind the grating.  Aim the Boomerang just to the left of the bridge, and it
will hit the switch on it's way around, causing the bridge to fall.  Cross the
bridge and go through the door on the other side.

------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Anubis Pit Room

As you enter the room, you'll encounter a new, flying enemy: an Anubis.  These
enemies can only be defeated with Fire.  This would be no problem if you had
the Fire Arrows, but that isn't an option as Young Link.  Use Din's Fire to
kill it (you can also use the fire trap activated by the crystal switch in the
room, but this takes far too long in my opinion).  If you get near the Anubis,
then it will try to push you off the cliff into the pit.

Once the Anubis is defeated, the door on the right side of the room will unseal
itself.  Go through it.

-----------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Lower Silver Rupee Chamber
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS094]
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

Run into the room, and Navi will warn you about Wall Masters.  Run around the
room in small circles until it appears (watch out for the Fire Keese), then
defeat it when it lands.  You can't gather the Silver Rupees in this room with
a Wall Master running around.

Once the Wall Master and Fire Keese are dead, gather the Silver Rupees from the
grating.  Two of them are near the bottom of the grating, two are near the top,
and one is in the corner on the opposite wall.  Watch out for the Gold
Skulltula on the left side of the grating; if you try to climb near it, you
will take damage, even though it's on the opposite side of the fence.

Once all of the Silver Rupees are gathered, then a bridge will appear in the
middle of the room, breaking the grating wall.  Kill the Keese before you try
to cross the bridge, otherwise they will try to knock you off.  Once all the
Keese are dead, cross the bridge.

Once on the other side of the bridge, turn around to face the grating.  There
is a Gold Skulltula on the right side of the grating.  Kill it and take it's
token with the Boomerang, then light both of the torches near the wall with
Din's Fire.  The lit torches will make a chest appear back on the other side of
the room.  Run back across the bridge and open the chest to get a Small Key.
Run back across the bridge and go through the door.

--------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Armos Knight Room

You'll come out of the door on the right side of the Armos Knight Room.  To the
right of the door as you come out is a crawlspace.  Go through it to it's other
side.

-------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Small Hall

Open the locked door on the other side of the hall and go through it.

-----------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - The Sun Cavern
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS095]

There is a tiled wall on the right as you come into the room.  Use the
Boomerang to kill two Skullwalltulas hanging from it, then climb to it's top.
At the top of the tiled wall, turn around to find another Gold Skulltula.  Use
the Boomerang to kill it and take it's token.

Run into the large cavern, and two Lizalfos will appear.  These are your old
friends from Dodongo's Cavern.  Unlike Dodongo's Cavern, however, you don't
have to wait for them to attack you before you can retaliate.  Go on the
aggressive this time around.  Kill the pair of Skulltulas on the wall, and then
look for the rock higher on the wall.  You'll know which one it is, since it
will have a narrow beam of light surrounding it (you can also Z-Target it).
Use a Bombchu to blow open the rock (if you don't have any Bombchus, then
activate the Crystal Switch on the wall to make a chest of them appear).  The
rock will be blown to pieces, revealing a patch of sunlight that will shine on
the sun panel on the floor.  The sun will light up, unsealing the door on the
opposite wall.  Go through it.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - The Colossus Chamber
New Dungeon Item: Dungeon Map

In this room, you'll find a smaller (but still gigantic) version of the statue
on the outside of the temple.  As you come out of the door, there is a statue
near you.  Grab hold of it, and push it off the cliff on the other side of the
statue.  It will fall, landing on a button.  The button will unseal a door on
an upper level.  Jump off the ledge to the bottom floor of the room.  Run
towards the center of the room, near the front of the Colossus statue, where
you will find a pair of torches.  Light them with Din's Fire to make a chest
appear.  Open it to get the Dungeon Map.

Return to the east side of the room, near to where you pushed the statue off
the cliff.  Climb back up the wall using the tiles.  At the top and to the left
of the tiled wall there is a staircase.  Climb up it, and up another flight of
stairs, and go through the door on the left.

-----------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - West Stairwell

Run up the stairs and through the door at their top.

-----------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Upper Silver Rupee Chamber
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

Another room filled with Silver Rupees.  This room also has the added bonus of
being filled with Blade Traps, low walls, and another sun panel puzzle.  Run
through the gap to the right as you enter the room, rolling past the Blade
Trap.  On the other side of the low wall, there are a number of stone blocks to
the left.  One of them has a sun panel on top of it.

Pull out this block, and push it into the beam of light on the northwest side
of the room.  Kill the Beamos near the stone blocks if you need to; it can
attack you while you are pushing the stone blocks around.  The sun panel will
light up, opening the door on the south side of the room.  Don't leave yet,
though; there's still a Small Key to be found here.

Gather the Silver Rupees around the room by jumping up to the low walls, and
moving slowly along the walls to gather them.  All of the walls can be jumped
up to by using the platforms beneath the three Beamos Statues in the room.
Destroy the Beamos statues to use the platforms.  Alternatively, you can also
use the stone blocks from the center of the room, but this takes considerably
longer.

Once you have all of the Silver Rupees, then the gold torch in the east side of
the room will light up.  Use this torch to light a Deku Stick, and in turn
light all of the unlit torches throughout the room.  If you can light all of
them without one of them going out, then a chest containing a Small Key will
appear.  There are three unlit torches in the room; one near the east door, one
in the northeast section of the room, and one near the south door.  The chest
appears on the low wall in the south side of the room.

Once you have the Small Key, go through the south door.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Upper West Stairwell
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS096]

Look above the door you come through to find a Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and
take it's token with the Boomerang, then go through the door at the top of the
stairs.

-------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - West Iron Knuckle Room

Run left as you enter the room to find a suit of armor sitting on a throne.
Strike the suit of armor to begin a miniboss fight.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Iron Knuckle

Iron Knuckles are tough, massive, and deal loads of damage.  You have two
methods of attack: either take the Stalfos method, by dodging the Iron Knuckles
relatively slow attacks, and then attacking in the aftermath of the Iron
Knuckles own attacks.  Or the easier, faster method is to just use Nayru's Love
and go kamikaze while you are invulnerable.  Even though you're invulnerable,
you can still be knocked around, so make some effort to avoid the Knuckle's
attacks.  If you choose the Stalfos method, then watch out for the Iron
Knuckle's ability to attack multiple times in a row.  If you run low on health,
then try to get the Iron Knuckle to knock over the pillars in the room, which
contain health and other items.  Once you whittle it down to half health, then
part of it's armor will break off and his movement and attack speed will
increase.  Don't bother blocking; it doesn't do much good against that massive
axe.

Once the Iron Knuckle is dead, then the door behind it's throne will open.  Go
through the door, and through the tunnel on the other side to find yourself
back in the Desert Colossus, high up in one of it's arms.

-----------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Desert Colossus (left arm)
New Equipment: Silver Gauntlets

The Mighty Owl of Long Winded Speeches, Kaepora Gaebora, returns.  Bet you
thought he (or maybe hoped) he was dead, huh?

After Kaepora Gaebora's speech, open the chest in front of you to get the
Silver Gauntlets.  As soon as you have them, a cutscene will take place.
You'll see Ganondorf's adopted mothers, Koume and Kotake, capturing Nabooru in
some kind of vortex.  Guess she won't be needing these Gauntlets, huh?

You're done in this dungeon with Young Link.  Play the Prelude of Light to
return to the Temple of Time.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Optional Dungeon: The Gerudo Training Ground (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Four)

-------------------
The Temple of Time

Retake the Master Sword to become Adult Link once again.  Once you're back as
Adult Link... nope, we're not going back to Desert Colossus just yet.  Now that
we have the Silver Gauntlets, it's time to get the final two Overworld Gold
Skulltulas.  Head for Hyrule Field, and go to Zora's Domain through Zora's
River.

--------------
Zora's Domain

Climb up to King Zora's throne room, and go through the opening behind his
throne to Zora's Fountain.

----------------------------
Zora's Fountain (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS097]

Use the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to.  Head for the southeast
area of the zone, to the entrance of the cave that leads to the Great Fairy's
Fountain (if you haven't opened that particular Fairy's Fountain, then it's on
the small island in the southeast area of the zone).  Now that you have the
Silver Gauntlets, you can lift the large gray rock in the middle of the cave
mouth (it was formerly invulnerable to bombs).  Underneath, you'll find another
rock.  Bomb this rock to destroy it and find a pit (sometimes this rock is
already destroyed).  Drop down the pit.

You'll land at the bottom of a ramp, winding up through the outer walls of
Zora's Fountain to an alcove high above.  Use the Lens of Truth as you climb up
the ramp to see several invisible Big Skulltulas.  Kill them with the Longshot.
At the top of the ramp, there is a ladder built into the wall.  Climb up it to
find yourself in an alcove.

Kill the (not invisible) Big Skulltula at the top, and then look on the wall
left of the top of the ladder to find the final Overworld Gold Skulltula.  Kill
it and take it's token.

Now that you have the Silver Gauntlets, then you can finish the Gerudo Training
Ground in it's entirety.  Whether you do the whole thing, or only part of it,
the reward is still the same: The Ice Arrows.  If you want, head there now, if
you haven't done it already.  See the appropriate Subchapter for the
walkthrough.

Otherwise, play the Requiem of Spirit to return to the Desert Colossus.

----------------------------
Desert Colossus (nighttime)
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS098]
New Upgrade: Piece of Heart x1 [HP35]

Play the Sun's Song to make it nighttime if you need to.

Go to the entrance to the Spirit Temple.  If you planted the Magic Beans as a
child, then there will now be a Magic Leaf to the left of the door.  Ride the
Magic Leaf, and it will fly around the Colossus, passing two large rocks in the
area, finally passing the arch near the entrance to the Temple.  Jump off after
the second rock, and if it's nighttime you'll find the game's last OVERWORLD
Gold Skulltula (the final two are found in the Spirit Temple).

Run back to the Magic Leaf, and this time ride it around until it flies by the
arch to the east of the entrance to the Temple.  Jump off the leaf onto this
arch to get the Piece of Heart.  The last Piece of Heart.  This should be
nineteen Heart Containers.  Just get the last Heart Container from Twinrova,
and you'll have the entire set!

Piece of Heart in hand, enter the Spirit Temple.

Before completing this chapter, also consider completing:
Happy Mask Trading Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-One)
Obtaining Epona (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Two)
Biggoron Sword Sidequest (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Three)
Optional Dungeon: The Gerudo Training Ground (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Four)
Big Poe Hunting (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Five)

The Spirit Temple is unique in that it is the only dungeon which requires both
Young Link and Adult Link to finish (with the possible exception of Dodongo's
Cavern, which contains a Skulltula only obtainable with Adult Link).  The
Temple is divided into two wings: The West Wing, and the East Wing.  The West
Wing is smaller, and is largely Young Link's territory.  The East Wing is much
larger, and is Adult Link's stomping grounds.  The Spirit Temple also contains
two Dungeon Items, one each for Young Link and Adult Link (though Adult Link is
the only person who can use either of them).  For Part II of the Spirit Temple,
we are dealing with Adult Link in the East Wing.

-----------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Entrance

Run forward and up the stairs (watch out for the pots who will hurl themselves
at you).  At the top of the stairs, go to the right to find a doorway blocked
by a giant blue block.  Run up to the block and grab hold of it, and now that
you have the Silver Gauntlets, you can push it forward.  Keep pushing it
forward until the block falls into a pit in the ground.

Run forward and up the stairs.  Bomb the Beamos, and then nail the Crystal
Switch on the ceiling above to open the doors on the left and right sides of
the room.  Go through the door on the right.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Rolling Boulder Room
New Dungeon Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS099]

This room contains yet another Silver Rupee puzzle (making your third for this
dungeon).  The Rupees are all scattered around a pit, which is filled with a
series of rolling boulders.  None of the Silver Rupees are particularly hard to
find, but to reach the one suspended slightly above the floor you'll need to
run out to it using the Hover Boots.  Switch back to the Kokiri Boots after you
get it.  All five of the Silver Rupees in the room will unseal the door on the
far side of the room.

To get the Gold Skulltula in this room, play the Song of Time near the Block of
Time to transport the Block of Time into an adjacent alcove.  The Gold
Skulltula is behind the Block of Time's original position.

Once you have unsealed the door and got the Gold Skulltula Token, go through
the door on the north side of the room.

-------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Small Chest Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

This room is seemingly empty, except for a single chest.  Step forward, and a
Like-Like will fall from the ceiling.  Kill the Like-Like, then open the chest
to get a Small Key.  Return to the Entrance of the Spirit Temple through the
Rolling Boulder Room.

-----------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Entrance

Go through the door on the west side of the room, the one we didn't go through
last time we were here.  If that isn't specific enough for you, then it's the
door that's not locked and the door that we didn't just come through.

------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Triforce/Compass Room
New Dungeon Item: Compass

As you come into this room, there is a Triforce symbol on the floor directly in
front of you as you enter.  Step towards it, and a Wolfos will appear.  Defeat
it in the usual fashion (backflip when it attacks, then use a Jump Attack on
it's exposed back), then step onto the Triforce symbol and play Zelda's
Lullaby.  A chest will appear on the opposite ledge.  Pull yourself over to it
with the Longshot, and open the chest to get the Compass.

Drop off the ledge and climb up the tiled wall on the opposite ledge.  At the
top, return through the door you came through, back to the Entrance Hall.

-----------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Entrance

Go through the locked door on the north side of the room, to your left as you
come out of the Triforce/Compass Room.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Lower Mirror Chamber

Move slowly forward as you come into the room, and watch out for a Like-Like
that falls from the ceiling, and the pots on the right side of the room who
will throw themselves at you.  On the other side of the room is a tiled wall,
on the east wall.  Climb up this wall.

At the top of the tiled wall is a large room which contains a number of sun
panels, a beam of light and a mirror.  Run around to the other side of the
mirror, where there is an invisible Floor Master.  Z-Target him (the lens is
optional) and use a Jump Attack to kill it one hit, then use Din's Fire to kill
it's offspring.  Now, turn your attention the mirror.

The mirror has two handles, one on the left and one on the right.  Stand behind
the mirror, and grab the left handle.  Push it forward until the mirror shines
the light of the sun onto each of the sun panels in the room.  The first two
sun panels will make chests appear (the first contains a recovery heart, the
second a frost trap).  The third panel will unseal the door in the west of the
room.  The last panel will make a Wall Master appear and attempt to capture
you.

Once the door is unsealed, go through it.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - The Colossus Chamber
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1
New Quest Item: Gold Skulltula Token x1 [GS100]

You're now back in the Colossus Chamber, which you last visited as Young Link.

Climb up the stairs directly in front of you as you enter.  Climb up the two
flights of stairs, and at the top look to the northwest, towards the Colossus
statue's left hand.  You can see that the hand has a drawing of a Triforce
symbol on it.  Equip the Hover Boots, then run out towards the hand.  If you
miss, return to the east side of the chamber and use the Longshot target on the
ceiling above the next ledge to pull yourself up.

Stand on the symbol on the left hand and play Zelda's Lullaby, and a chest will
appear on the opposite hand (the statue's right).  Re-equip the Kokiri Boots,
and use the Longshot to pull yourself over to the opposite hand.  Open the
chest to get a Small Key.  Drop down to the bottom floor.

Climb up the tiled wall on the west side of the room, and climb up both flights
of stairs.  At the top, look north, and Navi will flutter over to the other
side of the pit.  Play the Scarecrow's Song, and Pierre will appear on the
other side.  Pull yourself over to him with the Longshot.  Go around behind
Pierre to find another Gold Skulltula.  Kill it and take it's token.
Congratulations, that makes one hundred Skulltula Tokens.  When you're done
with the dungeon, then you can head back to Kakariko Village to get... a Huge
Rupee.  Uh... awesome?

Return to the west side of the chamber and pull yourself up to the next level
using the Longshot target on the ceiling.  Climb back up both flights of
stairs, and go through the locked door in the southeast corner.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Lower East Stairwell

Run forward, and blow up the Beamos with a bomb.  Keep going up the stairs, and
through the door at the  top.

---------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Treble Anubis Room

Young Link had to face one Anubis.  Adult Link gets to face three.  Use your
Fire Arrows to defeat them easily.  Bomb the Beamos statue on the north side of
the room, and the door in the southeast of the room will open.  Go through it.
If you're wondering, the switch activates a fire trap, which you can also use
to kill the Anubis in the room.  Which takes forever.  Use Fire Arrows.

------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Quad Armos Room

This room contains one of the more innovative and tricky puzzles in the entire
game.  Directly in front of you as you enter is a blue switch, which opens the
sealed door on the south side of the room.  To open it, you have to coax one of
the Armos Knights surrounding the switch into stepping on it, and staying on it
long enough for you to go through the door before it seals itself again.  The
easiest statue to coax into doing this is the one in the northeast corner of
the formation (the one closest to the wall and the beam of light).  Stand near
the sealed door, and shoot the Armos with an arrow.  It will come to life and
hop towards you.  When it steps on the switch, go through the door.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Upper East Stairwell

This room contains two chests, which contain lousy recovery hearts.  You can
use the Lens of Truth to see the chests, if you really need two recovery hearts
that badly.  Go through the door on the south side of the stairs.

-------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - East Iron Knuckle Room

Run into the room and to the right, and slash the suit of armor sitting on the
throne to begin a miniboss fight.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Iron Knuckle

Another Iron Knuckle guards the next of the dungeon's treasures.  Except now
you're twice as big, deal twice the damage, and have a sword which rivals the
Knuckle's axe, instead of that lousy twig, the Deku Sword.  The only downside
to being Adult Link it is much more difficult to dodge it's attacks.  Trying to
block the Iron Knuckle's attacks with the shield is (still) worthless, so use
the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by now).  As with the last
time you faced one of these guys, use Nayru's Love if the battle gets too hot.

A tactic that seems to work particularly well, but only works with Adult Link,
is to repeatedly perform a Jump Attack followed by a backflip, followed by a
Jump Attack, followed by a backflip, etc.  This doesn't work with Young Link,
but is practically fool proof with Adult Link.

Once the Iron Knuckle is dead, then the door behind it's throne will open.  Go
through it and through the tunnel on the other side.

------------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Desert Colossus (right arm)
New Equipment: Mirror Shield

As you come out onto the Colossus statue's outstretched hand, a chest will
appear.  Open it to get the Mirror Shield.  This is more or less the same as
the Hylian Shield, but comes with a number of useful perks: one, it looks
significantly cooler.  Two, it can reflect light.  Three, it can absorb certain
kinds of magic (this actually only works in one boss fight, but it's worth
mentioning).  Lastly, it can't be stolen by Like-Likes.  With the Mirror Shield
and the Kokiri Tunic equipped, Like-Likes suddenly aren't a problem.

Being careful not to fall (if you do you'll have to run back through the whole
dungeon), equip the Mirror Shield and return through the door you came through.

-------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - East Iron Knuckle Room

Run through the door in front of you, then through the door in the northeast
corner of the room.

-----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Upper East Stairwell

Run down the stairs and through the door on the north side of the room.

------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Quad Armos Room

Run to the north end of the room, past the Blade Trap and dodging the Armos
Knights.  Stand in the beam of light, and aim the Mirror Shield (hold R) at the
sun panel on the wall.  The door in the north of the room will unseal itself.
Go through it.

-----------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Small Key Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

Run into the room and open the chest to get a Small Key.  Go back through the
door you came through (geez this room was a waste of time... why not just make
the Sun Panel create a chest which creates a Small Key?).

------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Quad Armos Room

Go through the door on the west side of the room, to your right as you come out
of the Small Key Room.

---------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Treble Anubis Room

Head to the southwest corner of the room and go through the locked door.

----------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Sliding Panels Room

As you come into the room, kill the pair of Beamos on the pillars by throwing
bombs at them.  Look at the wall to the right after you do.  It's covered with
sliding panels, each of which contains a platform that can be climbed on.  Now,
you can either wait for the panels to align and climb up... or you can just aim
for the top panel and use the Longshot.  Your choice.

At the top of the ladder of panels, destroy both of the Beamos enemies and go
through the north door.

---------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Triforce Door Room

Go up the stairs, and stand on the Triforce symbol at the top.  Stand on it and
play Zelda's Lullaby, and the door before the triforce symbol will unseal
itself.  Go through it.

----------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Boss Key Room
New Dungeon Item: Boss Key

Kill all of the Fire Slugs in the room (remember, when they contract into a
tall cylinder-shape, they're about to attack), and then use Bombs and the
Megaton Hammer to destroy all of the false-doors in the room.  They look
identical to the false-doors from the Fire Temple, which look nothing like the
Spirit Temple doors, so it won't be difficult to identify them.

The false door to the left of the pillar of flames hides a golden eye.  Shoot
the eye with an arrow, and a second platform will appear high above the room.
Aim for the Longshot target above this platform, and then jump from that
platform to the one above the pillar of flames.  Step on the switch, and the
pillar will disappear, letting you access the ornate chest that holds the Boss
Key.  Once you have the Boss Key, return to the previous room.

---------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Triforce Door Room

Go right as you come out of the Boss Key Room, through the door on the west
side of the area.

--------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Upper Sun Chamber

Run forward as you enter the room, and two pots will fling themselves at you.
Block them with your shield, then activate the crystal switch behind the bars
to the left with a vertical sword slash or a spin attack.  The sealed door in
front of you will open.  Go through it.

Step into this room, and a Lizalfos will drop down from the ceiling.  Kill it,
then face go through the doorway on the left (the sun panel above the door only
reveals a chest which contains nothing fantastic).  Run into this next room
with the mirror, and defeat the White Bubbles with arrows and sword attacks.
White Bubbles are exactly the same as Red and Green Bubbles, but don't have
flame shields.

Go to the east side of the room, and drop a bomb on the odd formation of rock
there to blast open an opening to the next room.  Staying in the current room,
move around to the back of the mirror, grab hold of the left handle, and push
it until the mirror faces east, through the doorway you just opened.  Run
through that doorway now.

Defeat another Lizalfos who drops down from the ceiling, then run to the back
of the mirror in this room.  Grab hold of the left handle, and push it until
the mirror faces north.  Head back around to the door you came through to enter
this area and go through it.

Back in the first area of this odd room, notice that the beam of sunlight from
the two mirrors in the other half of the room are shining on the large mirror
on the ceiling.  Jump down into the pit, and stand in this beam of sunlight.
Use it to activate the sun panel on the west wall using the Mirror Shield, and
the floor will begin to lower - it's really an elevator.

Ride the elevator to the bottom to find yourself back in the...

--------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - The Colossus Room

Face to the north as you enter the room, so that you can see the face of the
Colossus statue.  The beam of sunlight from the room above is shining above
you.  Use the Mirror Shield to reflect the beam onto the statue's face, where
it will begin to disintegrate, revealing a grating.  Target the grating with
the Longshot, and pull yourself over to it.  When you land, the grating will
rise, revealing the Boss Door.  Go through it.

------------------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - Nabooru's Throne Room

Here you'll meet Koume and Kotake once more.  When last you saw these two, they
were capturing Nabooru.  These sorceress sisters raised Ganondorf as their son,
so you can imagine what nice old ladies they really are.  Best theme music
ever, by the way.

After the cutscene, the Iron Knuckle will come to life.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Iron Knuckle

This Iron Knuckle looks a little different then the others, but is really
basically identical.  Use the same strategies as before.  Remember to use the
Biggoron Sword if you have it (which you can, should, by now), since the shield
is basically worthless against the Iron Knuckle's attacks.  Again, if the
battle gets too hot, then use Nayru's Love.  The Backflip/Jump Attack trick
works really well on this Iron Knuckle as well.

After a relatively quick battle, the Knuckle's armor will fall off, revealing
Nabooru.  Koume and Kotake had brainwashed her, which was how she ended up as
Ganondorf's loyal servant.  The twins will appear again and capture Nabooru use
some kind of spell on Nabooru, whereupon she disappears, then teleport away
themselves.  Go through the door behind Nabooru's throne after this happens.

-------------------------------
The Spirit Temple - North Hall

Run down the hall and through another door at the end.

----------B-O-S-S----------
Sorceress Sisters TWINROVA
New Upgrade: Heart Container x1
New Quest Item: Spirit Medallion

When you enter Koume and Kotake's boss chamber, you'll be on a bottom floor
beneath a series of tall ledges.  Run forward and climb up the tiled wall to
the center, and largest, of these ledges.  Run to the center of the platform,
and after a cutscene the fight will begin.

The Sorceress Sisters have two distinct phases, both of which are very fun and
very exciting.  This is possibly the best boss fight in the game, so enjoy it
while you're here.  The Sisters each have their own element which opposes the
other.  Kotake is Ice, and Koume is Fire.  The first thing to know when
fighting them in this phase is that Z-Targeting is not your friend, and having
your sword out is not necessary.

Run around the platform, and try to get both of the sisters in your range of
vision at the same time.  That's the key to this part of the fight; keeping
both of them visible.  This is why Z-Targeting is not helpful.  After a while,
one of them will begin charging up an attack (you'll know they're doing it as
weird shapes will appear in front of them while they cast the spell).  Very
quickly, a beam will appear.  You have to now use the Mirror Shield to reflect
this beam into the other sister, much as you reflected the beams of light
earlier in the dungeon.  It's not easy to do, and will indeed take much
practice.  Don't even TRY to Z-Target to aim the beam; if you do, the beam will
just fire off in some random direction and won't even get near the other
sister.  No other methods of attack work (though the Fire Arrows and Ice Arrows
seem like they should... but they don't).

If you fail to reflect one of the beams, then it will impact on the floor,
creating a ring that damages you (and in the case of Kotake's ice beam, freezes
you... which sucks).  For this reason, if you know you can't reflect the beam
into the other sister, reflect it anyway.  It's better then the alternative.
After you reflect a few beams into each of the Sisters, then the boss enters
it's next phase.

Now truly Twinrova, the Sorceress Sisters form one entity.  So you can now Z-
Target.  If you have the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by
now), then use it for this stage of the fight, but keep it "Put Away" until
you're ready to damage Twinrova.  To "Put Away" the Biggoron Sword, stand still
until the A-Button on the command menu reads Put Away.  Then press the A-
Button.  After you've attacked Twinrova, you want to put the Biggoron Sword
away again.  You can only Put Away when you are not Z-Targeted.  If all of this
is too much for you, just use the Master Sword

As Twinrova, the sisters gain the ability to fire both Fire and Ice.  In order
to stun Twinrova and make her vulnerable to attack, you have to absorb three
spells of the same alignment IN A ROW.  This means that, if you absorb two fire
spells, then an ice spell, then the two fires will be negated and you have to
absorb two more ice spells.  Near the start of this phase, Twinrova will
generally use three shots in a row of the same alignment.  But later on, she'll
start mixing things up.  For this reason, only hold down the R Button to absorb
attacks you actually want.  Otherwise, release the R Button and dodge the beams
(dodge twice to the right or left to avoid most beam attacks, but make sure you
don't dodge right off the ledge).  You can tell which beam Twinrova is about to
use by looking at which wand she waves - the right is Ice, the left is Fire.
You can also tell which beams your Mirror Shield has absorbed by looking at it
- it flashes red for fire, and white for ice.  The faster it flashes, the more
beams absorbed.

After you absorb three beams of the same alignment in a row, then the Mirror
Shield will unleash a massive beam back at Twinrova (keep the shield drawn to
make sure the beam connects).  This will stun her momentarily, causing her to
fall to the platform below her.  At this point, quickly equip the Hover Boots
and draw your sword.  Run out to Twinrova.  When you're halfway across the gap,
use a Jump Attack to go the rest of the way and damage Twinrova at the same
time.  Then switch to basic sword strikes.  When Twinrova recovers, return to
the main platform and switch back to the Kokiri Boots, where the second phase
starts over.  When returning to the main ledge, it helps if you momentarily
release the Z-Lock on Twinrova.  Repeat the above steps until Twinrova is dead.

After Twinrova is defeated, a rather amusing cutscene of Koume's and Kotake's
deaths will take place.  Take the Heart Container that they leave behind, which
is on one of the outer platforms in the chamber.  This should also be your
twentieth Heart Container - congratulations.  Enter the beam of light opposite
the Heart Container to meet the Sage of Spirit: Nabooru.

Nabooru should be your sixth Sage (though it's possible to do the Spirit Temple
before doing the Shadow Temple).  Once all six of the sages are assembled
(Rauru, Saria, Darunia, Ruto, Impa and Nabooru), then a cutscene will take
place immediately after you get the final medallion.  Rauru will tell you to
return to the Temple of Time.

The Desert Colossus

Play the Prelude of Light to warp back to the Temple of Time.

-------------------
The Temple of Time
New Item: Light Arrows

As soon as you enter the Temple of Time, a cutscene will take place.  Zelda's
whereabouts are finally revealed - but she is captured by Ganondorf seconds
later.  What is also revealed is the location of the other two Triforce pieces
- Ganondorf only had one all along, which was why he was only able to really
screw up Hyrule instead of recreating it in his own image.  The last big
revelation in this cutscene is that there is a Seventh Sage - the Sage of Time,
Princess Zelda.  Zelda manages to give you the Light Arrows (the only weapon,
apart from the Master Sword, which can truly hurt him) just before she is
captured.  It's now time to head for Ganon's Tower (in the same place that
Hyrule Castle Garden was as Young Link) for the final dungeon and the final
showdown.

BUT FIRST!

Have you finished the Happy Mask Trading Sequence?  If you haven't, consider
checking the appropriate Subchapter.

Have you gotten the Biggoron Sword?  If you haven't, consider checking the
appropriate Subchapter.

Have you gotten the Ice Arrows?  If you haven't, consider checking the
appropriate Subchapter.

Have you gotten the Fourth Bottle?  If you haven't, consider checking the
appropriate Subchapter.

Have you found all of the Items, Songs and Upgrades?  If you haven't,
considering checking the appropriate Subchapter.  Note that the Gold Gauntlets
and the Half Damage Upgrade are available in Ganon's Tower, so you won't be
able to get them yet.

Have you found all 36 Pieces of Heart?  If you haven't, consider checking the
appropriate Subchapter.

Have you found all 100 Gold Skulltulas?  If you haven't, consider checking the
appropriate Subchapter.

If you've gotten all 100 Gold Skulltulas, have you gotten the reward from the
House of Skulltula?  If you haven't, then go get it now.  Because everyone can
use two hundred rupees.  Except the people who already have five hundred.

Once you're done deciding if you care about any of the above things, then head
for Ganon's Castle using the upper entrance in Hyrule Castle Market.  The Sages
will automatically create a bridge of light into the castle for you when you
near it's front entrance.  Enter the castle to begin the game's final dungeon.

Optional Dungeon: The Gerudo Training Ground (Subchapter Zero-Three-Four-Four)

Most of Ganon's Tower takes place, not in the tower, but in the Keep beneath
it.  The Keep is a large central hub, with six hallways branching off from it.
Each hallway represents one of the six Sages and their alignments - Forest,
Fire, Water, Shadow, Spirit, and Light.  In each hallway, there is a seal which
must be destroyed, which will lower the shield surrounding the entrance to
Ganon's Tower in the center of the Keep.  At the top of the Towers resides
Ganon and the final showdown.

---------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Entrance

Run down the stairs as you enter the dungeon.  At the bottom of the flight of
stairs, run right between the pair of Beamos statues and through the door.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

You're now in the hub of Ganon's Castle, the Keep.  There are six hallways
which branch off from this central area, each representing one of the six
Magical Alignments which you've encountered (one for each Temple, plus one for
the Light Temple, which you never visit in this game).

Go right as you enter the Keep, and you will reach a door with the Forest
Medallion emblazoned above it.  Go through this door.

---------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Forest Seal Room One

Step into the middle of the room, and a Gray Wolfos will appear.  Defeat it in
the usual fashion (wait for it to attack, backflip out of the way, then Jump
Attack when it's back is turned).  A chest will appear, which contains a Blue
Rupee.  Stand on the carpeting in the middle of the room, and use Din's Fire to
light the four torches surrounding the carpet.  Next, use a Fire Arrow to light
the torch above the sealed door.  The door will unseal itself.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Forest Seal Room Two

I bet you're getting tired of Silver Rupee puzzles.  Yeah, they are used a
little excessively late in the game.  As always, if you fall into a pit in this
room, then you will have to collect the Silver Rupees over again.

This room contains a number of ledges, a bottomless pit, four powerful fans,
and five Silver Rupees.  As you enter, look to the left to see a Silver Rupee
hanging above a pit.  Navi will flutter down underneath the Silver Rupee; play
the Song of Time when she does this, and a Block of Time will appear.

Equip the Iron Boots to keep the fan from blowing you around, and then walk out
onto the Block of Time to take the rupee.  Wait for the fan to stop blowing,
then switch to the Hover Boots.  Stand still and wait for the fan to start
blowing again.  Run towards the ledge on the left side of the room when this
happens, and the fan's wind will blow you to the ledge.  You'll pass just
underneath a Silver Rupee on the way; you can't get it just yet.

Switch back to the Kokiri Boots, and toss a bomb over to the Beamos statue to
destroy it.  Jump out to the Beamos statue's vacated platform, then go to the
right side of the room to gather another Silver Rupee.  Jump back to the Beamos
statue's platform, then jump towards the sealed door.  Climb up to the front of
the sealed door, and look to the right to see another Silver Rupee in front of
a fan.  Wait for the fan to stop blowing, then jump out to grab the Silver
Rupee.  Jump back before the fan starts blowing again, or alternatively just
equip the Iron Boots and wait for the fan's next blowing cycle to cease, then
jump back.

Look to the left of the sealed door, and there is another fan.  Beneath the fan
is another platform, with a switch on it.  Wait for the fan to stop blowing,
then jump down to the switch.  Stand on it, and a Longshot statue will appear
beneath that single Silver Rupee we couldn't reach before.  Longshot yourself
up to the statue, and then grab the Silver Rupee.  The sealed door on the other
side of the room will unseal itself.  Jump over to it using the Beamos statue's
platform, and go through the door.

-----------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Forest Seal Room Three

This room contains a green sphere; this is the Forest Seal.  Destroying all six
spheres in the Keep will remove the barrier in the middle of the Keep, letting
you enter Ganon's Tower.  Shoot the barrier with a Light Arrow, and Saria will
appear.  She will send you back to the Keep.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Head to the right as you come out of the Forest Seal hallway, and go right down
the stairs.  At the bottom is a door inscribed with the Water Medallion.  This
was the third dungeon in the game, but it will be the second seal that we
finish.  Go through it.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Water Seal Room One

Run forward into the icy room, and stalactites will fall from the ceiling.  Two
Freezzards will also appear.  Kill both of the Freezzards (Fire Arrows work
quite well), and the door behind the wall of ice will unseal itself.  Capture
some of the Blue Fire in the center of the room in an empty bottle, and then
use it to melt the sheet of ice blocking the door.  Fill another bottle with
Blue Fire, then go through the unsealed door.  Don't bother with the chests in
the room; unless you like unpleasant things happening to you, of course.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Water Seal Room Two
Time Limit: 2:00

In this room, you have two minutes to finish a block-pushing puzzle similar to
the one you solved previously in the Ice Cavern.  There are two ice blocks in
the room; run to the left side of the rear block, and push it to the right so
that it collides with a rock in the ground.  Then go to the left side of the
block, and push it forward so it lands in a pit in the front of the room.

Now, go to the remaining Ice Block, go to it's right side and push it forward,
so that it slides across the pit you just filled in with the other block.  Go
to the block's right side again (the side closest to the door you came
through), and push the block forward.  Now go around to the side of the block
closest to the right wall, and push it forward to the opposite wall.  Jump up
onto the ice block, and from there jump up to the ledge.  Use your bottle of
Blue Fire to melt the ice.  Press down the rusted switching using the Megaton
Hammer to unseal the door in the rear of the room.  Go through it.

----------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Water Seal Room Three

Shoot the orb with the Light Arrows to dispel it.  Ruto will appear, and
transport you back to the Keep.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Go right up the stairs, and through the door emblazoned with the Shadow
Medallion.

---------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Shadow Seal Room One
New Equipment: Gold Gauntlets

Look to the left as you enter the room, and you'll see a chest.  Use the
Longshot to pull yourself over to the chest.  Alternatively, you can also use
the Song of Time to make three Blocks of Time appear, where you can then reach
the chest with the Hover Boots.  The chest contains a Blue Rupee.

Turn around from the chest to see an unlit torch.  Light it with a Fire Arrow,
and a series of platforms will temporarily appear.  Run along these platforms
towards the back of the room to a larger platform.  Defeat the Like-Like on the
platform, then turn around and relight the same torch that you lit before with
the Fire Arrows.

Keep heading towards the back of the room using the renewed platforms.  On the
next platform, look to the right to see more of the opaque-platforms.  Quickly
run down them and step onto the switch before time runs out and the platforms
disappear again.  If you have to, just wait for the torch to go out again, and
relight it.  A chest will appear back on the previous ledge; go to it and open
it to get the Gold Gauntlets.  With these, you can hurl aside the various Black
Obelisks that appear both inside and outside Ganon's Castle (they don't appear
anywhere else in the game, so don't worry about having to backtrack too far).

Look to the left side of the room from this platform, and use the Lens of Truth
to see an invisible path.  Follow it to the rusty switch.  Smash it with the
Megaton Hammer to activate it.  The door in the back of the room will unseal
it.  Head back to the Gold Gauntlets platform, and use the Lens of Truth to see
another invisible path leading towards the unsealed door.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Shadow Seal Room Two

Destroy the seal with a Light Arrow, and Impa will appear to return you to the
Keep.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Before we move on with the dungeon, head back outside the castle.  It's time to
unearth one last fairy fountain.

---------------
Ganon's Castle

Head back across the bridge of light, and go left under the arch on the other
side.  Climb over the rubble here and go to the end of the small canyon.  With
the Gold Gauntlets, you can pick up the black obelisk here and hurl it aside,
revealing a Fairy Fountain (in fact, the same Fairy Fountain where you got
Din's Fire as Young Link, though it's a different Great Fairy inside).  Go into
it.

-----------------------
Great Fairy's Fountain

Run forward and stand on the Triforce Symbol, and play Zelda's Lullaby to make
the Great Fairy appear (sorry, I'm out of bondage jokes.  Wait!  I think
there's a joke in there somewhere... nope, got nothing).  She'll enhance your
defenses - in essence, doubling your health.  Notice how your heart containers
now have a white border.  Head back into Ganon's Castle and return to the Keep.
If you've got the Ice Arrows, the Fourth Bottle, all 20 Heart Containers and
all 100 Gold Skulltulas, then you now have every single thing in the game.
Congratulations.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Run to the right and past the Forest, Water and Shadow Seals.  Enter the door
emblazoned with the Fire Medallion past the Shadow Seal.

-------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Fire Seal Room One

You can't complete this Seal without the Gold Gauntlets, so if you don't have
them yet then head back to the Shadow Seal to get them.

Equip your Goron Tunic as you enter to survive the heat of the room.  Jump
forward onto the platform in front of you, and it will begin to sink into the
lava.  Run forward until the platform branches left and right, and go right.
Jump out to the platform and grab the Silver Rupee, but watch out as this
platform will begin sinking almost right away.

Jump back over to the other platform, and go right on the other side.  Go left
at the corner, and straight at the branch.  Jump from the platform onto the
ledge with the rotating flames.  Hang on the edge of the ledge until it's safe
to climb up, otherwise you'll get knocked down into the lava and have to start
the Silver Rupee puzzle all over.

Follow the path of the flames around to the rear of the platform, and take the
second Silver Rupee.  Keep following around, just behind the spurting flames,
and jump back onto the sinking platform.  Run right around the corner, and go
left at the split.  Go left again at the next split, and follow the path to the
end.  Jump out to the platform, then jump again to the narrow ledge.  Climb up
to the black obelisk, and with the Gold Gauntlets you can throw it aside, where
it will land across the room.  Take the Silver Rupee that was underneath the
pillar, then turn around and head back to the sinking platform.

Go straight at the split, and jump out to the ledge with the Fire Slug.  Kill
the Fire Slug, and take the Silver Rupee.  The pillar you tossed aside earlier
is now forming a makeshift bridge to the last Silver Rupee.  Jump out to the
pillar, and then to the last Silver Rupee.  The door in the rear of the room
will now unseal itself.  Jump back to the Fire Slug's platform, and then to the
sinking platform.  Look towards the back of the room, and use the Longshot on
the target to the right of the now-unsealed door to pull yourself over to it.
Go through the door.

-------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Fire Seal Room Two

Destroy the Seal with a Light Arrow, and Darunia will appear to send you back
to the Keep.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Go to the right and down the stairs from the door to the Fire Seal.  At the
bottom of the stairs, there is another black obelisk.  Throw it aside, where it
will shatter against the shield guarding Ganon's Tower.  The door behind the
black obelisk is inscribed with the Light Medallion.  Go through it.

--------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Light Seal Room One
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

This room is full of invisible enemies; namely, a Big Skulltula and four
invisible Keese.  Use the Lens of Truth to find and kill them all, then open
the chest that appears in the middle of the room to get a Small Key.  Go
through the locked door in the rear of the room.  You can open the other chests
in the room if you like, but all they contain is junk and traps.

--------------------------------------------

New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

I shouldn't have to explain this one.  Oh, you're still here?  Okay, I will
anyway.  Stand on the triforce symbol and play Zelda's Lullaby.  Open the chest
that appears to get a Small Key.  Go through the now-unlocked door.

Time Limit: 1:00

O Great God of the Silver Rupee Puzzle, how I loathe thee.

This room contains a pillar in the center of the room, with a pair of boulders
who roll continuously around it.  Look on the ceiling above the pillar to see a
Longshot target.  Pull yourself up to it using the Longshot.  When you land,
you will get the first Silver Rupee.

Look to the left of the sealed door on the other side of the room, where you
will find a small alcove with the second Silver Rupee.  Wait for the boulders
to pass by, then jump down and grab it.  From this alcove, run back towards the
pillar in the center of the room and into the alcove beside it to get another
Silver Rupee.  Head around to the opposite side of the pillar, where you will
find two more identically placed Silver Rupees; one in alcove, another near the
pillar.  Once you get all five of the rupees, then the sealed door will unseal
itself.  Go through it.  The clock is still ticking, so go fast.

----------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Light Seal Room Three

You will step into a room identical to the other rooms which contains the
Orb... only the orb is not there.  Use the Lens of Truth, and you'll see the
wall on the other side of the room is fake.  Walk through it, to find the orb.
Shoot it with a Light Arrow, and Rauru (remember Rauru?) will appear to send
you back to the Keep.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Go to the right from the Light Seal door, and up the flight of stairs.  At the
top there is a door emblazoned with the Spirit Medallion.  Go through it.

Inside Ganon's Castle - Spirit Seal Room One

The Bad News: Another Silver Rupee Puzzle.  The Good News: The Last Silver
Rupee Puzzle.

Most of the Armos Knights in this room are conveniently placed to block the
Blade Traps, so avoid touching or moving them to keep this happy equilibrium in
place.  Destroy the Beamos statue directly in front of you with a Bomb or a
Bombchu, then use the Longshot target on the ceiling to pull yourself up to the
rupee above the (former) Beamos.  Take the second Silver Rupee from behind the
Beamos.

Gather the three remaining Silver Rupees from near the Blade Traps in the
corners of the room.  With the defensive spell from the Great Fairy's Fountain
outside Ganon's Castle, the Blade Traps shouldn't deal much damage.  Just walk
right into the Blade Traps to get the Silver Rupees.

Once you have all five of the Silver Rupees, the door in the rear of the room
will unseal itself.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Spirit Seal Room Two

Destroy the pair of Fire Slugs in this room, then look towards the steel bars
on the left.  There is a Crystal Switch just on the other side.  Use the Spin
Attack to activate the switch, making a chest appear.  Open the chest to get
some Bombchus - the clue to solving this puzzle.

Return to the steel bars, and look in the back of the room to see another
Crystal Switch between two torches.  Stand back a bit, line yourself up with
the crystal switch, and let loose a Bombchu.  It will go forward, through a gap
near the top of the bars, and to the other side of the room, activating the
switch.

Hey, those Bombchus had to be good for something, right?

Go through the door after it unseals itself, and around the corner on the other
side.  In this next room, look up on the ceiling to see an odd clump of white
goo on the ceiling.  It's actually a spider web.  Destroy the spider web with a
Fire Arrow, and a beam of sunlight will shine into the room.  Use the Mirror
Shield to activate the sun panels in the room.  The sun panel you want is the
one to the right of the tunnel you came through (if you face the sealed door,
it's directly behind you and to the right).  The other sun panels will just
make Wall Masters appear, who you must then defeat.

Once the door is unsealed, go through it.

-----------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Spirit Seal Room Three

Destroy the Orb here with a Light Arrow, and Nabooru will appear and send you
back to the Keep.  This should be the last of the six seals, so the barrier
surrounding Ganon's Tower will disappear.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

With the barrier around Ganon's Tower gone, head to the right until you see a
bridge to the left.  Go across this bridge and through the door to enter
Ganon's Tower.

----------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor One

Kill the quad of Fire Keese in this room, then head up the spiral staircase to
the left.  Watch out for the Fire Keese on your way up the stairwell.  At the
top, go through the door on the right.

----------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Two

When you enter the room, both of the doors in the room will seal themselves.
You'll have to defeat both of the Dinolfos in the room before it will open.  If
you didn't do the Gerudo Training Ground, then this will be your first
encounter with these guys.  Basically think of them as Lizalfos with the attack
power of a Stalfos.  Treat them like Lizalfos and attack aggressively.  The
same defensive strategies that worked against Lizalfos will also work on these
guys.

Once both of the Dinolfos are defeated, then the doors will unseal.  Go through
the one on the other side of the room (the door that the camera focuses on when
the doors unseal).

--------------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Two Staircase

Climb up the stairs, and at landing on top, go through the door on the left.

------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Three
New Dungeon Item: Boss Key

Step into the room, and two Stalfos will appear.  The large pillar of flames in
the middle of the room makes fighting this pair of Stalfos a delicate matter.
Remember, to defeat Stalfos, dodge their attacks, and attack back immediately
after the Stalfos attack.

Once both of the Stalfos are dead, then the pillar of flames in the middle of
the room will die away, revealing an ornate chest.  Open it to get the Boss
Key.  Go through the door behind the chest.

----------------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Three Staircase

Climb up the stairs, and at the landing on top, go through the door on the
left.

-----------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Four

As you enter the room, the doors will once again seal themselves.  On the other
end of the room, there is not one... but two Iron Knuckles.  Use the usual
strategy to defeat them: dodge their attacks, and use Jump Attacks with the
Biggoron Sword to deal damage.  If you shoot one of them with an arrow, then it
will come to life and come towards you without disturbing the other.  If you
wake them up one at a time in this fashion, then you can do the Backflip-Jump
Attack trick, which they still haven't learned to defend against.

If you missed my explanation of this trick in the Spirit Temple, it basically
works like this: wait for the Iron Knuckle to attack, then backflip, then use a
Jump Attack, then backflip, then Jump Attack, etc. etc.  If you accidentally
awaken both of the Iron Knuckles, then using Nayru's Love is an excellent idea.

Once both of the Iron Knuckles are defeated, then the doors will unseal
themselves.  Go through the door that the camera focuses on.

---------------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Four Staircase

Climb up the stairs, and at the landing on top, go through the boss door on the
left.

-----------------------------------------

This room contains a ton of pots.  Smash them to find Magic Power and Recovery
Hearts, if you need them.  Go through the door to the right of where you came
in to head further up the tower.

Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Five Staircase

Climb up the stairs, and at the landing on top, go through the boss door on the
left.

---------B-O-S-S----------
King of Thieves GANONDORF

Navi is unavailable during this fight, meaning you can't Z-Target and she can't
give you advice with C-Up.  Once Ganondorf is stunned with a Light Arrow, then
Navi can Z-Target again, but Navi becomes unavailable once more when Ganondorf
recovers.

Those of you who liked the Phantom Ganon fight (which should be everyone) will
be very pleased to hear that this is very similar.  There are a few nuances to
this fight that are quite different, though.  For one, Ganondorf remains
stationary in the center of the room.  He also has a Shockwave attack, which
will collapse bits of the floor, creating pits that lead back down to the Tower
Floor Five area.  For this reason, don't go near Ganondorf until he is stunned,
or else he will use the Shockwave and make this fight more difficult then it
needs to be.

Ganondorf will throw balls of lightning at you, which you must reflect back at
him with sword strikes (or you can use Empty Bottles if you're feeling
creative).  If you miss a ball of lightning and it doesn't hit you, then it
will destroy whatever floor panel you happen to be standing on, knocking you
down to a lower floor.  You'll have to climb back up using the tiles on the
pillar in the middle of the room.

Ganondorf will reflect the balls back at you as well, so keeping reflecting
them until one strikes and stuns Ganondorf.  There is a new wrinkle to the
fight at this point; you must now shoot Ganondorf with a Light Arrow, whereupon
he will become stunned.  You can now Z-Target him.  Quickly equip the Hover
Boots and use them to cross the pit in the middle of the floor.  Just like in
the Twinrova fight, use a Jump Attack when you're halfway across the pit to
deal extra damage to him, then switch to normal attacks.  When Ganondorf
recovers, run back to the perimeter of the room and switch back to the Kokiri
Boots.

Ganondorf will occasionally use a new attack where he will charge up a lot of
power (you'll know when he's doing it, as he will hold up both arms to create
the spell instead of just one arm for the Lightning Ball).  To stop him from
using this attack, shoot him with a Light Arrow.  This will instantly stun him,
letting you get in more attacks.  As always, use the Biggoron Sword if you have
it.  Which you can, and should, have it by now.  Ganondorf's cape acts as his
life meter; the more tattered it becomes, the closer to death he is.  Once
Ganondorf is defeated, keep that controller ready - the game isn't over yet.

---------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Exterior

Ganondorf's apparent demise has destroyed the tower.  You and Zelda must now
race down the tower before it crumbles.  You've got three minutes to escape the
tower before it is destroyed... with you inside.

Follow Zelda down the tower.  Only she can open the sealed doors on the way
down, so there's no point getting too far ahead of her.  When she opens the
door at the bottom, go through it.

-----------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Five

Go to the left, keeping near Zelda to ensure that she keeps moving.  When she
gets to the other side of the room, she'll open the door.  Go through it.

Jump over to the ledge that Zelda stands on, and keep following her down the
tower.  At the bottom, she'll unseal another door.  Go through it.

Keep following Zelda down the tower.  When she opens the door at the bottom, go
through it.

------------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Floor Three

Keep near Zelda in this room, and when she reaches the middle of the room
she'll be trapped behind a pillar of flame.  Two Stalfos will appear, and
you've got to defeat them to progress.  You don't have time to play it
carefully, so use Nayru's Love and the Biggoron Sword and just go kamikaze on
the Stalfos.  Once they are both dead, Zelda will be freed.  Run near her, and
she'll proceed to the opposite door and open it.  Go through it.

---------------------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Tower Exterior

Keep following Zelda down the tower.  When she opens the door at the bottom, go

open it.  Go through the door here, and keep following Zelda down the stairs.
At the bottom, Zelda will open the door on the left.  Go through it.

-----------------------------
Inside Ganon's Castle - Keep

Run along to the end of the bridge.  Run past the Redead (whose sole purpose
seems to be to waste whatever precious seconds you may have remaining), or kill
it with the Biggoron Sword.  At the other end of the bridge, Zelda will open
the door.  Go through it and up the stairs on the other side, and wait for
Zelda to open the final door to escape the tower.

--B-O-S-S--
GANON

After a cutscene, run forward towards the ruins of the tower, where Ganondorf
will emerge.  Except now he has been transformed into the evil demon Ganon.
Thanks, Triforce of Power!

At the start of the fight you won't have access to the Master Sword.  Which
doesn't really matter, since Shields are useless against Ganon, and you should
have the Biggoron Sword by now.  If for whatever reason you don't have the
Biggoron Sword, then the Megaton Hammer will have to make due.  For this
ultimate showdown, Navi will be available for you to Z-Target Ganon, unlike in
the previous fight against him.

Like all evil demons of the underworld, Ganon's weakspot is his tail.  In his
first phase, you'll have to Z-Target Ganon and then begin performing side
dodges (hold right or left and press A) to speed around behind Ganon.  When you
get behind him, do a Jump Attack with the Biggoron Sword or Megaton Hammer to
deal a hefty amount of damage to Ganon.  After you hit his tail, he will raise
it up out of your reach.  Begin strafing around back to his front side, and his
tail will lower, letting you strafe back around to attack his tail again.
Repeat this method until a cutscene shows the flames around the perimeter of
the arena lowering.  Run over to Zelda and retake the Master Sword when this
happens.

If you have the Biggoron Sword, then stay with it for now.  If you were using
the Megaton Hammer as your weapon, then switch back to the Master Sword now.
Return to Ganon to begin the final phase of the fight.  Your goal is still the
same: attack the evil fiend's tail.  Except now, you can't just strafe around
to it.  You have two options: shoot him in the face with a Light Arrow, or
release your Z-Target and roll between his legs.  Whichever path you choose,
once you are on his backside, Z-Target him and perform a Jump Attack on his
tail.  If you are using the Biggoron Sword, do ten or so Jump Attacks, then
switch to the Master Sword.  Only the Master Sword can defeat Ganon.  After a
cutscene, you will be prompted to attack Ganondorf while he is being held in
place by Zelda's magic.  Do this, and the game is over.  Too bad the final boss
wasn't that creative.

The Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest is the only Sidequest available to Young
Link.  The sidequest begins at the Happy Mask Shop in Hyrule Castle Market, at
any time after the opening the gate to Death Mountain Trail.  The Happy Mask
Salesman Sidequest ultimately nets you the Mask of Truth, which lets you get
hints from the Gossip Stones that dot Hyrule.  It also lets you make a little
money, but not much.  The only thing you really get out of this sidequest which
is worth mentioning is a Deku Stick and Deku Nut capacity upgrade, both of
which are obtained in the Forest Stage (for more information on this, see
Walkthrough or the Upgrades chapters).

-------------------------
Mask #1: The Keaton Mask
Sold To: Guard near the gate to Death Mountain Trail in Kakariko Village.
Borrow Price: 10 Rupees
Sell Price: 15 Rupees

This mask is in the shape of a Keaton's face.  A Keaton is a popular
mythological creature in Japanese lore.  The Guard who buys this claims it's
for his son, but he's the one who wears it all the time.  The Guards buys it
for more then it's worth, so you'll make a five rupee profit on it.

------------------------
Mask #2: The Skull Mask
Sold To: The Lone Skullkid in southwest Lost Woods.
Borrow Price: 15 Rupees
Sell Price: 10 Rupees

This mask is in the shape of a Skull.  The lone Skullkid in Lost Woods feels
inadequate next to his friends, so sell him this mask to boost his ego.  The
Skull Mask also lets you access the Deku Stick capacity upgrade in the Forest
Stage.  The Skullkid buys the fifteen rupee mask for only ten rupees, so you
lose five rupees on this one.

-------------------------
Mask #3: The Spooky Mask
Sold To: Dampe's Fanboy in the Kakariko Graveyard (daytime only)
Borrow Price: 30 Rupees
Sell Price: 30 Rupees

This mask is sold to Dampe's Fanboy, the little kid who walks around Kakariko
Graveyard and pretends to be Dampe (he only appears during the day).  You break
even on this one; the mask sells for thirty rupees, and the boy buys it for
thirty.

------------------------
Mask #4: The Bunny Hood
Sold To: The Running Man in Hyrule Field (only after Jabu-Jabu's Belly is
finished)
Borrow Price: 50 Rupees
Sell Price: 500 Rupees

The Running Man appears in Hyrule Field after Dungeon III, Jabu-Jabu's Belly,
has been finished.  Once you find him, you'll have to chase him until he stops
(the Sun's Song is no help).  He'll buy the Hood for five hundred rupees, but
if you don't have the Giant's Wallet then you'll only get 99 or 200 out of that
five hundred.

---------------------------
Mask #5: The Mask of Truth

The Mask of Truth, the best of the available masks, lets you use the Gossip
Stones around Hyrule to receive hints.  Which would be cool, except only Young
Link can wear the Mask of Truth, and by the time you get the Mask, you're
practically done with Young Link.  The Mask of Truth can also be used in the
Forest Stage to earn a Deku Nut capacity upgrade.

------------------------
Mask #6: The Goron Mask

When worn, this Masks makes those lovably foolish Gorons mistake you for an
actual Goron, who will deplore about what a small, weak Goron you are, and
insist you eat something.  Ain't they the greatest?

-----------------------
Mask #7: The Zora Mask

If you speak to Zoras while wearing this mask, they will sarcastically treat
you the way you'd expect a little kid running around in a mask to be treated.


-------------------------
Mask #8: The Gerudo Mask

If you thought this mask would actually fool any of the Gerudos, then go jump
off a cliff.

Obtaining Epona is a relatively simple task once you know how to do it, but
actually getting to the point where you can unlock her has been known to
confuse certain players.  Given that the entire game can be beaten, and beaten
easily, without obtaining Epona, it's not unusual for younger or casual players
to completely miss their opportunity without realizing it.

In order to ride Epona, and later take her from the Ingo-controlled Lon Lon
Ranch, you must first learn Epona's Song from Malon as Young Link.  This can be
done at any time after meeting Zelda and learning Zelda's Lullaby.  Head for
Lon Lon Ranch during the daytime, and head for the middle of the pasture.
Speak with Malon until she mentions her mother, then pull out your Ocarina
(Fairy Ocarina, Ocarina of Time, it doesn't matter which).  Malon will then
teach you Epona's Song, which tames Epona and also makes any Cow in the game
give you a free bottle of Lon Lon Milk.

Fast forward to Adult Link.  This next step can be done at any time after
becoming Adult Link, and can even be the very first thing you do once you
arrive.  Run to the pasture in the rear of the ranch, and speak with Ingo.
After a lengthy speech about how great Ganondorf is, Ingo will offer to let you
ride a horse for ten rupees.  Do so, and you will be allowed into the pasture.
Ignore the horse that Ingo offers you, and play Epona's Song.  Epona will
appear and run towards you.  This is where it gets tricky; you can't take Epona
just yet.  Ride out your time in the pasture, then speak with Ingo again.
Agree to ride again, and this time speak to Ingo while riding Epona and he will
challenge you to a race for fifty rupees.

At this point, you and Ingo will both appear on the track around the pasture
riding your horses.  In the first race against Ingo, he goes fairly slowly, and
takes the corners very wide.  Stay close behind him until he gets near a
corner, then quickly hug the inside rail and burn two or three carrots to shoot
in front of him.  At this point, just carefully steer yourself to stay directly
in front Ingo, preventing him from getting in front of you.  You don't even
have to use carrots.  If he gets in front of you, wait for Ingo to take the
next wide corner and shoot in front of him again.

After you win the first race, Ingo will have a meltdown and frantically bet
Epona on a rematch.  Agree.  This time, Ingo will cheat and leave the starting
gate a second before the clock goes off.  Even though he now goes slightly
faster and cheats at the start, the race is still identical, and he still takes
turns incredibly wide.  Wait for the first turn in the track, and burn two or
three carrots to shoot in front of him while he takes the wide corner.  Now,
it's a simple matter of staying in front of him and blocking his progress
forward.  The occasional use of a carrot may be necessary.

After the race, Ingo will honor his bet and give you Epona.  But he also will
close the gate to the Ranch and refuse to let you leave.  You'll have to jump
the gate using Epona.  Return to the track going around the pasture, and run
around it in a counter-clockwise direction (the opposite direction you go in
the race).  Use one carrot, then wait for it to regenerate, then use it again,
to keep your speed up.  When you reach the last turn in the course and can see
the gate directly in front of you, burn all six of your carrots at once and run
straight at the gate.  If you aim yourself properly you'll soar right over the
gate and Epona will now be yours to use in Hyrule Field, Lake Hylia, Gerudo
Valley and Lon Lon Ranch.  Simply play Epona's Song to make her appear.

The Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest is the Adult Link equivalent of the Young
Link Happy Mask Salesman Sidequest.  Well, calling it the equivalent isn't
technically accurate, since it is much longer, harder, and the reward is
actually "rewarding."  The trading sequence can be completed immediately after
obtaining Epona, and since Epona can be obtained immediately after becoming
Adult Link, it is strongly recommended that you waste no time in getting the
Biggoron Sword.  It is especially useful in several upcoming Boss Fights,
including Phantom Ganon and Morpha.

Using any of the Transportation Songs (Prelude of Light, Minuet of Forest,
etc.) will automatically set the timer on any Timed Items to 0:01.  DO NOT USE
TRANSPORTATION SONGS WHILE DOING TIMED STEPS.  I'll say it again.  NO
TRANSPORTATION SONGS ON TIMED STEPS.  BAD NO NO BAD.  The Sun's Song is okay to
use, though, even if it does end up transporting you back to the start of an
area.  Several steps of the sequence, particularly Part IX, are much easier if
you planted all of the Magic Beans as a Child.

As a last bit of advice, if you don't have Epona, don't even bother trying.
Also, if you are doing this entire string in one go as soon as you acquire
Epona, I STRONGLY recommend that you ignore any Heart Pieces and Gold
Skulltulas along the way, and focus entirely on completing the quest chain.
This will reduce confusion later on if you are following a guide (namely, this
guide).

--------------------------------------------
Part I: The Pocket Egg and the Pocket Cucco

In order to obtain the Pocket Egg, head for Kakariko Village and speak with the
Cucco Lady.  She is standing near the pasture in the rear of town, near the
entrance to the Kakariko Graveyard.  Once you have the Pocket Egg, play the
Sun's Song until the Pocket Egg hatches into the Pocket Cucco.  Make sure that
it is daytime, then enter the building at the bottom of the stairs near the
middle of town.  Talon is sleeping on the bed.  Use the Pocket Cucco while
standing near Talon, and he will awaken.  If you've stolen Epona and liberated
Lon Lon Ranch, then speak with Talon and he'll return to the Ranch (at which
point you can return and complete a Time Trial minigame that nets you your own
personal Cow).  Otherwise, he'll just stand around.  Return to the Cucco Lady
and show her the Pocket Cucco, and she'll give you Cojiro, the Blue Cucco.

----------------
Part II: Cojiro

Now that you have Cojiro, head for the Kokiri Forest and into the Lost Woods
using the entrance behind Mido's House.  Go left at the first crossroads to
reach the clearing where the Lone Skull Kid used to dance as Young Link.  The
Skull Kid is gone, replaced by the Carpenter's Son.  Show him Cojiro, and the
Carpenter's Son will admit that he has been cursed, and the only cure is a
Potion which must be made from an Odd Mushroom.  He'll give you the Odd
Mushroom.

--------------------------
Part III: The Odd Mushroom
Time Limit: 3:00

The Odd Mushroom is on a three minute time limit, so you have to high tail it
back to Kakariko Village.  If you planted the Magic Bean at the valley behind
the Carpenter's Son, then use it to reach the bridge leading to Hyrule Field
more quickly.  Otherwise, return to Hyrule Field via Kokiri Forest.  Back in
the Field, get on Epona and ride her to Kakariko Village in the northeast
corner of the Field.

Once inside the village, head for the Potion Shop near the north edge of town
(it has a picture of a large boiling cauldron above it's door).  Enter the shop
(it must be daytime to work), and go through the passage on the left side of
the store to reach the grotto behind the buildings.  Jump down from the ledge
as you come out of the door, and climb up the stairs on the opposite side of
the grotto.  Enter the building and show the Hag inside the Odd Mushroom.  She
will turn it into the Odd Potion.

If you fail to reach the Hag before the time limit runs out, then return to the
Carpenter's Son to get another Odd Mushroom.

------------------------
Part IV: The Odd Potion

Return to the Carpenter's Son in the Lost Woods.  Remember, he is to the left
as you enter the Lost Woods from the entrance behind Mido's House in Kokiri
Forest.  When you reach the clearing, however, the Carpenter's Son is gone, and
is replaced by a Kokiri Girl.  You arrived too late to save him from the curse.
Give the Kokiri Girl the Odd Potion, and she'll give you the Poacher's Saw.

--------------------------
Part V: The Poacher's Saw

Return to Hyrule Field, and head for Gerudo Valley on the west side of Hyrule
Field (nine o'clock on the clock face).  Ride Epona up the log bridge, and
charge straight at the broken bridge using Epona at maximum speed to leap over
it.  Alternatively, you can also use the Longshot, if you have progressed that
far in the game.

Speak with the Carpenter on the other side of the bridge, standing outside of
the tent, and then show him the Poacher's Saw.  He'll recognize it as his own,
and give you the Broken Goron's Sword.

----------------------------------
Part VI: The Broken Goron's Sword

There is only one craftsman in all of Hyrule who can repair this once mighty
weapon: The Biggoron of Death Mountain.  Head for Kakariko Village and then go
up Death Mountain Trail.  If you planted a Magic Bean at the entrance to
Dodongo's Cavern, then use the Magic Leaf to ride to the halfway point of Death
Mountain.  If you didn't plant the Magic Bean, then you'll have to take the
long way.

Once you're at the peak, arouse Biggoron's attention by standing on the right
side of the cliff, and then show him the Broken Goron's Sword.  He'll admit
that he'd love to  repair the Sword, but he can't because the last eruption
blinded him.  You'll have to get some medicinal eyedrops from the King Zora
first.

---------------------------
Part VII: The Prescription

Return to Hyrule Field, and go to Zora's River (three o'clock on the clock
face).  If you planted the Magic Bean near the start of the River, then ride it
to the end.  Enter Zora's Domain, and climb to the top of the cavern to reach
the King Zora.  If you haven't done the Ice Cavern yet, then King Zora will
still be encased in red ice.  But you can still unfreeze him if you're doing
the entire quest string as soon as you have obtained Epona.  If you have
already unfrozen the King Zora, then give him the Prescription and skip to the
next step.

You have two options to unfreeze King Zora: you can either go to Kakariko
Village and purchase a Blue Flame from the Potion Shop there (for a hefty 300
rupee price tag), or you can head for the Ice Cavern ahead of schedule and get
a Blue Flame for free.  The Ice Cavern is a little ahead of you
chronologically, but the mini-dungeon is incredibly easy, so don't be afraid to
enter it.

Go to Zora's Fountain using the entrance behind King Zora's throne, and enter
the Ice Cavern by standing on Jabu Jabu's altar, and jumping along the frozen
platforms in the pond until you reach the northern edge of the Fountain.  Enter
the Ice Cavern, and run down the passage to the first room.  Kill the three
Freezzard's in the room using sword strikes or Din's Fire while dodging the
Blade Trap.  Enter the door that opens.

Run down the hall to the next room, which contains a large blade made of ice
that rotates steadily.  Gather all of the Silver Rupees in the room, and enter
the door that opens.  Run to the end of this passage, and in the next room run
along the different platforms to the pillar of Blue Fire on the second level.
Watch out for Ice Keese and Freezzards along the way.  Capture the Blue Fire in
a bottle, and return to the King Zora.  Use the bottle of Blue Fire while
standing next to the King to unfreeze him.  Show him the Prescription, and
he'll give you the ingredients needed.  But you'll have to take them elsewhere
to get the Eyedrops made.

----------------------------
Part VIII: The Eyeball Frog
Time Limit: 3:00

The Eyeball Frog must be delivered to the scientist in the Observatory at Lake
Hylia in less then three minutes.  This would be no problem with the Lake Hylia
shortcut in Zora's Domain... except that the entrance is blocked as Adult Link.
Curses!

Quickly run back out to Zora's River, and ride the river back to Hyrule Field.
Hop aboard Epona and hightail it to Lake Hylia, which is in the southwest
corner of the Field.  Use Epona to hop over the fences and save time wasted
trying to climb over them on foot.  Ride Epona right into the Lake Hylia area
and right to the doorstep of the Observatory.  Step inside and show the
Scientist the Eyeball Frog, and after mistaking them for his dinner, he'll make
you the Eyedrops.

If you run out of time, then speak with King Zora again to get another Eyeball
Frog.

-----------------------------
Part IX: Biggoron's Eyedrops
Time Limit: 4:00

You've now got to run clear across Hyrule and climb Death Mountain in less then
four minutes.  No problem, right?  With Epona and the Magic Leaf out front of
Dodongo's Cavern, you should make it with plenty of time.  Without the Magic
Leaf, you'll be pushing it, and without Epona, you don't stand a chance.

Step outside the Observatory and get back on Epona.  Ride her back to Hyrule
Field, and jump back over the fences.  Go to Kakariko Village in the northeast
corner of the zone.  Get off Epona and enter the Village, then go to Death
Mountain Trail in the north of the Village.  If you planted the Magic Beans as
a child, then ride the Magic Leaf at the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern to the
halfway point of the mountain, then climb the rest of the way.  Otherwise,
you'll have to take the long way up, and you'll be pushing the clock if you do.
Give Biggoron the Eyedrops.

------------------------
Part X: The Claim Check

Now that he can see again, the Biggoron will repair the sword.  Free of charge.
What a guy.  Play the Sun's Song six times to force three days to pass, then
show Biggoron your Claim Check.  He'll give you the Biggoron Sword for all your
trouble.  The Biggoron Sword deals twice the damage that the Master Sword does,
but is so large that you can't handle a Shield while using it.

The Gerudo Training Ground is a series of obstacle courses and timed
challenges, built in a rough square around a central "Treasure Room."  This
Treasure Room contains, among other useless trinkets, the Ice Arrows.  These
arrows are absolutely worthless in progressing the game forward, but are a fun
item to have and use nonetheless.

In this walkthrough for the Gerudo Training Ground, instructions are given on
how to complete each room, though no specific order is given on when to
complete each room.  Traditionally the rooms are completed clockwise from the
entrance hall, and the order of the rooms in this guide reflects this.  You can
tackle them in any order you wish, however.  You need a minimum of seven keys
to reach the Ice Arrows, and once you have acquired this number of keys the
dungeon is essentially "finished" and you can go about your business elsewhere.
The remaining chests in the Treasure Room, especially those going to the right
from the main entrance, contains useless junk which isn't really worth
bothering with.

The dungeon cannot be completed "fully" without the Silver Gauntlets from the
Young Link portion of the Spirit Temple.  However, the Ice Arrows can be
obtained without the Silver Gauntlets.  Go left through the first door in the
treasure room from it's main entrance, and you will reach the Ice Arrows before
you run out of keys.  Remember, you need a minimum of seven keys to reach the
Ice Arrows.  Since there is a hidden key in the Treasure Room itself on the way
to the Ice Arrows, once you have six keys then you can head for the Treasure
Room to get your reward and leave the dungeon.

The Gerudo Training Ground is only available after Adult Link rescues the
captured Carpenters in Gerudo Fortress and becomes an honorary Gerudo Thief.
For instructions on how to accomplish this, see the appropriate Subchapter,
"Return to Gerudo Valley."  The entrance to the Training Ground is on the
southeastern edge of the Gerudo Fortress.  Speak with the Gerudo Lieutenant
standing near the steel grating, pay the entrance fee, and she will let you in.

--------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Entrance

Run forward up the stairs as you enter the Training Ground.  At the top of the
stairs, turn around and look up above the door frame to see a golden eye
switch.  Shoot the eye switch with an arrow, and a chest will appear in between
two of the pillars in the room.  Open it to get a bundle of arrows.  Another
chest in between the pillars opposite contains a Blue Rupee.

There are three doors in this room.  The one directly opposite the entrance
leads to the Treasure Chamber, which should be your last destination.  The
doors to the left and right of the Treasure Chamber go to the Gerudo Training
Ground.  The entire Training Ground loops around, connecting back to this room.
You can go left or right.  This guide starts on the left side.  If you choose
to go right first, then skip to the last heading of this subchapter, and follow
the guide backwards.

-----------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Sand Stalfos Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key
Required Items: None
Hint: Defeat all the enemies in a LIMITED TIME!
Time Limit: 1:00

This room contains a sand pit and a pile of rocks.  Run past the Blade Trap and
into the room, and a pair of Stalfos will appear.  Defeat them in the usual
fashion, and in under 1:00, and a chest containing this room's Small Key will
appear.  Keep moving at all times; you will slowly sink into the sand, making
it harder to move, if you don't stay moving.  Go through the door to the right
of the treasure chest containing the Key, and into the next room.

---------------------------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Silver Rupee/Rolling Boulder Room
Required Items: Hookshot
Hint: Gather the JEWELS OF WHITE, while avoiding traps and danger!
Time Limit: 1:30

This room is made of three hallways, which has a number of Silver Rupees
scattered around it.  The outer halls contain rolling boulders which will try
to knock you into cliffs near the bottom half of the room.  The small passages
connecting the halls contain Wall Masters.  Remember, if you enter First Person
Mode, then the Wall Masters will disappear temporarily.

Look up as you enter the room, and you will see a Longshot target on the
ceiling.  Pull yourself up to it with the Longshot (the Hookshot if you still
haven't done the Water Temple).  You may have to run down the hall a bit and
then turn around before you can get a good shot off.

Run down the hall, and take the first passage on the left (ignore the passages
on the right).  In this passage, wait for a boulder to pass by in the hall in
front of you, then quickly run left around the corner.  Grab the Silver Rupee
near the cliff edge before a boulder comes along and knocks you off the cliff.
Turn around and run up the cliff, all the way to the top.  Grab the Silver
Rupee in the alcove here.  Turn around, head back down the hill and take the
second left.  At the top of the hill, look to the right and off the cliff to
see another Silver Rupee.  Jump out and grab it.

At the bottom of the cliff, look to the left to see a ramp leading up.  Run up
the ramp, and take a right at the top.  Run down the hill (watching for rolling
boulders), and take a right at the bottom of the hill into the next passage.
Grab the Silver Rupee here, but watch out for the sheet of flame that will
erupt just behind the Silver Rupee.  This Silver Rupee will unseal the door at
the back of the room.

Turn around and run back up the hill, all the way to the last passage on the
left.  At the top of the ramp, look to the right and on the ceiling to see a
Longshot target.  Pull yourself up to it with the Hookshot/Longshot, and over
another curtain of flame.  Go through the door here.

----------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Large Block Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1
Required Items: Bombs, Hookshot, Lens of Truth, Silver Gauntlets
Hint: Without the necessary items, one will be confounded by impossible
mysteries.

Step into the room, and a Wolfos will appear.  Use the Backflip to Jump Attack
maneuver to defeat it quickly, and a second Wolfos will appear.  Defeat it, and
run deeper into the room, where a White Wolfos will appear.  These Wolfos are
larger, but are still identical to Gray Wolfos in terms of strategy.  Another
White Wolfos will appear in the corner of the room if you pass near it.  Once
all four Wolfos are dead, a chest will appear which contains a bundle of
arrows.

Against the far wall, there is the outline of a doorway which is blocked by a
blue stone block.  If you have the Silver Gauntlets, then you can push it
forward to find a door to a small room.  Enter this door to find a small room
which houses three Like-Likes.  Kill them all, and two chests will appear.  Use
the Lens of Truth and look in one of the small pits in the room to find an
invisible chest, which contains a Small Key.  Open the chest, then return to
the previous room.

Destroy the False Door against the wall using Bombs or the Megaton Hammer, then
look on the wall above it with the Lens of Truth to see an invisible passage.
Pull yourself up to the Longshot Target with the Hookshot/Longshot.  If you
step on the switch inside this hallway, then the door that you came through
will unseal itself.  Go through the door at the end of the hall.

----------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Totem Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x2
Required Items: Bow and Arrow
Hint: Blind the EYES OF THE STATUE!

When you enter the room, you will be on a high ledge.  Run along the ledge to
the right, where there is a door.  Go through it and open the chest inside to
get a Small Key, then return to the Totem Room.

Jump off the ledge, landing on a rotating platform on the lower level.  Pull
your Bow and fire arrows into the eyes of the statue in the middle of the room.
Let the rotating platform carry you into the range of the next eye, don't move
yourself.  You'll know you've hit the eyes properly if the statue makes a
groaning noise and the eye turns red.  The eyes will reset after a short time,
so you have to hit them all in one pass.

After all of the eyes are pierced with arrows, then a chest will fall down in
front of the statue, and the door on the lower level will unlock.  Pull
yourself over to the chest with the Longshot (just jump if you don't have the
Longshot), and then open the chest to get a Small Key.  Jump into the lava to
warp back to the beginning of the room if you don't have the Longshot.

Go through the door on the lower level of the room once you're done.  The door
on the upper level leads to one of the side entrances of the Treasure Room.

------------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Flaming Enemy Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1
Required Items: Megaton Hammer, Bow & Arrow
Hint: Find a secret passage in this room!

Run into the room and start massacring all of the numerous Fire Slugs and Fire
Keese who run around here.  Once all of them are dead, a door will unseal
itself and a chest will appear.  Open the chest to get another bundle of
arrows.

Using the Megaton Hammer, smash all of the statues around the perimeter of the
room.  The two statues to the right of the chest of arrows hide a switch and a
golden eye.  Shoot the eye with an arrow, and the other door in the room will
unseal itself.  Step onto the switch, and the pillar of flames guarding the
chest in the center of the room will deactivate.  Open it to get a Small Key.
Go through the door to the left of the chest (it's the door which isn't at the
end of a hallway).

---------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - The Sea of Fire
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1
Required Items: Hookshot, Song of Time
Hint: Cross the Sea of Fire!

Another Silver Rupee puzzle.  If you fall in this room at any time, you will
have to get all of the Silver Rupees over again.

Run forward as you enter, and turn around and look above the doorway when you
reach the end of the cliff.  Pull yourself up to the Longshot target here with
the Hookshot/Longshot to get the first Silver Rupee.

Walk to the edge of the cliff, and on the left you will see a platform with
another Silver Rupee on it.  Jump down to it.  To the right is another
platform.  Jump out to it.  Navi will flutter out into an empty space in the
middle of the room; play the Song of Time here to make two Blocks of Time
appear (if only one appears, you didn't get close enough - but one is enough).
Climb up onto the Blocks of Time, and from there jump to the high ledge against
the right wall.  Take the Small Key that lies up here.  The doorway leads to
one of the Treasure Chamber side entrances; ignore it.

Jump back out to the lower Block of Time, and from there jump to the left to
get another Silver Rupee.  Jump back to the Block of Time, and then jump out to
the next platform with a Silver Rupee on it.  Look to the right here to see
another platform, which has a switch on it.  This switch deactivates the pillar
of flames on the other side of the room, letting you get the last Silver Rupee.
To reach it, jump back to the Blocks of Time, and jump up to the upper ledge.
From there, jump to the platform containing the Silver Rupee before the pillar
of flames returns.

Once you have all five Silver Rupees, the door on the left side of the room
will unseal.  The pillar of flames will reactivate after you get the Silver
Rupee, knocking you off the ledge.  But the door will remain unsealed.  Go
through that door.

---------------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Underwater Rupee Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1
Required Items: Iron Boots, Song of Time, Hookshot
Hint: Gather the UNDERWATER GEMS!

Run into the middle of the room, and play the Song of Time to make the Blocks
of Time in the floor vanish.  Equip the Iron Boots and the Zora Tunic, and then
sink into the pool of water beneath the Blocks of Time.

Defeat all of the Shell Blades at the bottom of the pool with the Hookshot, and
watch out for the Blade Trap.  You have two choices on gathering the Silver
Rupees in the room: one, you can try to use the Longshot targets in the room to
pull yourself into the rupees, or you can alternate between the Iron Boots and
the Kokiri Boots to get them.  I prefer the latter method, even though the
pool's winding current makes this slightly tricky.

Once you have all five Silver Rupees, a chest will appear back above the pool
of water.  Climb out of the pool and open the chest to get a Small Key.  Change
back to the Kokiri Boots and whichever Tunic you like, and return to the Sea of
Fire.

---------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - The Sea of Fire

From the door to the Underwater Rupee Room, head to the left side of the Sea of
Fire and go through the door there.

-------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Dinolfos Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1
Required Items: Bombs,
Hint: Defeat all the enemies in a LIMITED TIME!
Time Limit: 1:30

In this room, you will face a powered-up version of the Lizalfos, the Dinolfos.
Treat them like regular Lizalfos, just be wary of their increased attack
ability.

Blow up the Beamos statue with a Bomb or Bombchus, and then kill the Dinofols
in the room.  Watch out in the perimeter of the room; there are curtains of
flame that will erupt and damage you if you're not careful.  Once both of the
Dinolfos and the Beamos are dead, then a chest containing a Small Key will
appear.  Take the Small Key, and then go through the door to the left of the
Dinolfos Room to return to the entrance.

--------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Entrance

Go through the door across from the entrance and into the Treasure Room.

-------------------------------------------
The Gerudo Training Ground - Treasure Room
New Dungeon Item: Small Key x1

This room contains nine locked doors - which might seem problematic, since you
only have eight keys (seven if you tried this dungeon before you got the Silver
Gauntlets).  Luckily, the ninth key is hidden in the room itself.

If you are doing this dungeon without the Silver Gauntlets, then go left first.
In the first room on the left, use the Lens of Truth and look on the ceiling
above to find a hidden passage.  Use the wire wall to the left of the door to
climb up into it (if you don't have the Lens of Truth either, then just keep
climbing into the ceiling until you pass through the ceiling).  At the top,
you'll find a chest which contains Key #8/#9.  The secret passage into the
Treasure Chamber from the Sea of Flames leads to the right side of the Treasure
Room, so don't get any bright ideas about shortcutting to the Ice Arrows.

The Treasure Room contains numerous chests, which appear as follows:

Right from the entrance -
Bombchus, Bundle of Arrows

Left from the entrance -
Purple Rupee, Red Rupee, Bundle of Arrows, Ice Arrows

Once you have the Ice Arrows, then you can just leave (you'll have to walk out
- warp songs don't work in here).  The other items in the treasure room are
nothing to get excited about.  If you screw up and go wrong the way at the
start, you'll run out of keys.  You'll have to return to the Training Ground
with the Silver Gauntlets to get the last of the dungeon's nine keys, letting
you access the Ice Arrows.

Big Poes can only be obtained with Epona and the Bow and Arrows, as Adult Link.
If you don't have either Epona or the Bow and Arrows, then you can't capture
them.  Don't even attempt this until you have finished the Forest Temple,
though it can be completed at any time afterwards.

The time of day is meaningless for this sidequest.  Big Poes all appear in
Hyrule Field, and each individual Poe appears in the same place, no matter what
time of day.  Riding near a Big Poe will cause it to become visible and start
to run away.  If it gets too far away from you or if it makes it to a cliff
wall, then the Big Poe will disappear and you'll have to try again.  After
killing a Big Poe with two arrows, then it will become a Wisp which can be
captured like a normal Poe in an Empty Bottle.  Deliver captured Big Poes to
the Poe Shop in Hyrule Castle (the building on the left as you first enter
Hyrule Castle).  Once you capture all ten and take them to the Poe Man, he'll
give you the game's final bottle.

If you run out of arrows while attempting this sidequest, then return to
Kakariko Village and buy more from the Bazaar there (rupees are essentially
irrelevant at this point in the game, so go ahead and blow your wad), or get
them from the bushes that grow throughout Hyrule Field.

Regular Poes appear in the same places that Big Poes do while on foot.  These
can be killed while on foot, but don't be fooled; they don't count as Big Poes.
Big Poes only appear while on horseback, though once they are killed you can
get off Epona to capture them in an empty Bottle.

------------
Big Poe #01
Location: The signpost immediately south of Hyrule Castle.

The best way to get this Poe is to ride west from the stone bridge near
Kakariko Village straight at the signpost south of Hyrule Castle.  This sends
the Poe running into open fields in pretty much all directions, making it very
easy to shoot down and capture.

------------
Big Poe #02
Location:  The cliff overlooking the entrance to Kakariko Village.

This is hands-down the hardest Big Poe in the game to kill.  Pretty much the
only way to make it appear is to ride right up to the edge of the cliff, at
which point the Poe will appear and begin to fly away.  You now have to kill it
before it gets out of range, because Epona refuses to jump off the cliff.
Pulling out your bow as you ride up to the cliff, before the Poe appears, helps
a lot on this one.  Honestly, your best bet is to just fire arrows rapidly and
randomly to kill it.  Good luck on this one, because that's what it takes.
Luck.  Once you manage to shoot down the Poe, quickly get off Epona and jump
off the cliff to go after it.  Don't try to ride down and across the bridge
with Epona, or else the Poe will vanish before you get there.

------------
Big Poe #03
Location:  The stone wall east of Lon Lon Ranch.

This one is much easier then Big Poe #02.  Simply ride south along the wall's
eastern edge, and the Big Poe will appear at the point where the wall breaks to
the left.  This also works going east along the wall's southern edge.  Don't
try to take the Poe on from the northern side of the wall, otherwise you will
be stuck behind the wall in a situation very similar to Big Poe #02.

------------
Big Poe #04
Location:  The intersection of the Y-Shaped Road southeast of Lon Lon Ranch.

This Big Poe is quite easy.  The best way to get it is to ride west from the
entrance to Kokiri Forest, straight for the gray stone near the crossroads of
the Y-Shaped road (the road is easily recognizable on the map).  Keep heading
west past the stone, and the Big Poe will appear.  Steer Epona through the gap
in the fence west of the stone, and kill the Poe with arrows as you pass
through the gap.

------------
Big Poe #05
Location:  The center of the grove of golden-leafed trees in Southeast Hyrule
Field.

This Poe isn't that hard to shoot, but can be tricky to force him to come out
of hiding.  Head for the grove of trees in southeast Hyrule Field with the
golden leaves.  Go right up to the wall, and turn around.  Look for the tan-
colored stone in the middle of the grove of trees, and start riding at the gap
to the right of the stone.  The Poe will appear in this gap, with a long
stretch of empty field behind him.  This will be another easy capture.


------------
Big Poe #06
Location:  South of the tree at the bottom tip of the Y-Shaped Road.

Head for the bottom tip of the Y-Shaped Road, and you will find a tall tree
standing by itself.  Riding from the east to the west, pass by the south side
of this tree to make the Big Poe appear.  There isn't a whole lot of room left
before the Poe reaches the wall, but there is still enough that you can miss a
few shots.

------------
Big Poe #07
Location:  The intersection of the three-way road near Gerudo Valley.

The hardest thing about this Poe is getting it to not appear inside a wall.
The key to this Poe is keeping in mind that the direction they move in is
entirely dependant on the way your character is facing when the Poe first
appears.  So if you are facing a wall when it appears, then it will run right
into a wall as soon as it appears.  That's the fun (or is that "fun") part of
about this one: all the frickin' walls all over the place.

The easiest way to get it is to approach from the south, hugging the west wall.
As you approach the three-way split near the Gerudo Valley road, slowly turn
Epona so that you are facing towards the gap and headed more or less down the
road.  If you do it correctly, then you will pass right over the point that
makes the Poe appear, and the Poe will move in the perfect direction for you to
easily kill it.

------------
Big Poe #08
Location:  The lone tree west of Lon Lon Ranch.

This one is easy.  Simply ride north from the road near Gerudo Valley (the same
road that you got Poe #07 from), and pass by the west side of the tree to make
the Big Poe appear.  The only disadvantage to this one is the Poe will be going
uphill, making this an extremely difficult shot.  Your best bet is to not even
try to shoot it when it first appears, but just follow it to the top of the
hill, and then shoot it when the hill levels out further up.

------------
Big Poe #09
Location:  South of the river in northwest Hyrule Field.

This is another one that is difficult to make appear, but is then relatively
easy to kill.  Head for as far northwest as you can go on Epona, so that way
you are literally hugging the corner where the wall and the river meet.  Turn
around, and ride southeast, pointing yourself more or less at the tree which
can just barely be seen in the distance, near the entrance to Lon Lon Ranch.
The Big Poe will appear near one of the bushes as you pass by them.  Be
persistent; this Poe is shy.

------------
Big Poe #10
Location:  The lone tree near the entrance to Lon Lon Ranch.

The last, and one of the easiest Big Poes.  Run a fair distance east of the
entrance to Lon Lon Ranch, and then turn around and start going west.  Brush
along the southern edge of the tree outside Lon Lon Ranch, so that you pass
between the tree and the walls of Lon Lon Ranch.  The Poe will appear here.
Kill it and take it back to the Poe Shop, and you'll have earned your Bottle.

-----------
Deku Stick
First Found: Kokiri Forest
Used By: Young Link

Deku Sticks are tools commonly used by Young Link.  With them, Young Link can
light the Sticks on a lit torch, and transfer that flame to adjacent torches
around the room.  The Stick expires if lit for too long.  Deku Sticks are
commonly found on Deku Babas; to obtain them from the enemies, stun them and
then kill them while their stem extends straight in the air.

---------
Deku Nut
First Found: Inside the Deku Tree
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

An item used exclusively in combat, Deku Nuts explode in a bright flash when
they strike the ground.  The flash temporarily stuns all enemies in the area
who are vulnerable to the stun.  Deku Nuts are particularly effective against
the bubble-like Shabom enemies in Jabu-Jabu's Belly, as the bubbles are
destroyed by the Nut's flash.  Deku Nuts have absolutely no effect on more
powerful enemies, i.e. Minibosses and Bosses.
----------------
Fairy Slingshot
First Found: Inside the Deku Tree
Used By: Young Link

The first ranged weapon in the game, the Fairy Slingshot is also the weakest
ranged weapon in the game.  It is one of the items used most regularly by Young
Link, but it is effectively replaced by the more powerful Boomerang, which also
has the bonus of having infinite ammo.

--------------
Fairy Ocarina
First Found: Kokiri Forest
Used By: Young Link

A gift from Link's Kokiri friend, Saria, the Fairy Ocarina is essentially a
placeholder for Young Link until he obtains the Ocarina of Time after the third
dungeon.  The Fairy Ocarina is used most frequently to open doorways using
Zelda's Lullaby, but can be used to play other songs.

--------
Bottles
First Found: Various Locations
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

Bottles, long a staple of the Zelda series, are used to store helpful
restorative items like Fairies and Lon Lon Milk.  Bottles can also be used to
capture Bugs and Blue Fire, which have their own uses in the game.

The first bottle in the game is obtained with Young Link, and is won from Talon
in Lon Lon Ranch after you have awoken him in the Hyrule Castle Garden.  Find
all three of his "Special Cuccos" in the flock of Normal Cuccos, and he'll
award you with an Empty Bottle, the first of four.

The second bottle in the game is also obtained by Young Link.  In Kakariko
Village, gather all of the Cuccos in town and return them to the Cucco Pasture
near the entrance to Kakariko Graveyard.  Three of the Cuccos can only be
reached by gliding off of cliffs and over fences using other Cuccos.

The third bottle in the game is, again, obtained by Young Link, and is also the
only Bottle that you HAVE to get.  Once you have earned the Silver Scale, head
for Lake Hylia and dive down to retrieve the Bottle from the Lake's bottom.

The last bottle in the game is the only one found by Adult Link.  Once you have
Epona and the Fairy Bow, hunt down and capture all ten of the Big Poes in
Hyrule Field and deliver them to the Poe Shop in Hyrule Castle.  The Poe Man
will give you the fourth bottle when you do.  For information on completing
this sidequest, see the "Walkthroughs and Sidequests" chapter.

------
Bombs
First Found: Dodongo's Cavern
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The "Goron's Special Crop" is stored in a special pouch made from a Dodongo's
Stomach.  Bombs can be used to blow open weakened walls, and are required to
defeat certain armored enemies and solve a number of other minor puzzles.  They
are also instrumental in defeating the King Dodongo.  The Bombs are first found
as the dungeon item in Dodongo's Cavern.

---------
Bombchus
First Found: Hyrule Castle Market
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

An item which is used only three times in the whole game (once in a minigame,
once in the Spirit Temple, and once in Ganon's Castle), Bombchus are mobile
bombs which follow a straight line and then explode when they contact
something.  They have the ability to climb along walls, and to a lesser extent
ceilings.  The earliest time that you can obtain them is in the Hyrule Castle
Market, immediately after finishing Dodongo's Cavern.  You can either buy them
from the shop in the Back Alley, or win them from the Bombchu Bowling Alley.

-----------
Din's Fire
First Found: Hyrule Castle Garden
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

When used, this spell creates a ring of fire that expands out and encompasses
everything in the room.  It will burn any enemies it makes contact with, and
also lights any unlit torches it makes contact with.  Din's Fire is used
primarily to solve several torch-lighting puzzles throughout the game, but is
also useful against several smaller, weakened enemies, such as the Mini-Floor
Masters.  Din's Fire can be obtained from the dead end in Hyrule Castle Garden
immediately after obtaining the Bombs from Dodongo's Cavern.

------------
Magic Beans
First Found: Zora's River
Used By: Young Link

The Magic Beans can be planted in the plots of soft earth that dot the Hyrule
countryside as Young Link.  Once planted, these beans begin to grow, and when
you return to these areas with Adult Link, you will find a flying Magic Leaf
that can be used to access out-of-reach areas.  The Magic Beans are purchased
from the Bean Man upstream from the entrance to Zora's River.  He has ten total
to sell.  The Magic Beans cost 10 Rupees initially, but raise in price by 10
rupees for each successive purchased Bean, until the final Bean reaches 100
rupees.  All 10 Beans cost a grand total of 550 rupees.  Since most of the
Magic Leaves that you use as Adult Link to lead to either Heart Pieces of Gold
Skulltulas, then the price is more then worth it.

--------------
Farore's Wind
First Found: Zora's Fountain
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

Farore's Wind is a really great spell, the only problem with it is most people
forget to use it.  With it, you can set a Waypoint somewhere in a Dungeon, and
using the spell again elsewhere in the dungeon will let you return to the
original waypoint.  Farore's Wind is obtained from a Great Fairy in Zora's
Fountain.  Use a bomb to open the wall in the southeast area of the fountain,
which leads to the Fountain.

----------
Boomerang
First Found: Jabu-Jabu's Belly
Used By: Young Link

An important item for Young Link, as it is the first item in the game which has
the ability to grab items and return them to you from a distance.  Namely, Gold
Skulltulas.  The Boomerang also has the ability to defeat certain enemies, and
stun others.  It essentially replaces the Fairy Slingshot as soon as you get
it, but still isn't used much since you are practically to the Adult Link part
of the game when you first obtain it, and Adult Link can't use it.  Sucks to be
you.  When aiming the Boomerang, you can use Link's head as a targeting
reticule.  Just line up your target with the back of Link's head, and let go.
The Boomerang is the dungeon item in Jabu-Jabu's Belly.

----------------
Ocarina of Time
First Found: Hyrule Field
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The Ocarina of Time replaces the Fairy Ocarina that Young Link gets from Saria,
and it's magical qualities allows you to open the Door of Time and access the
Sacred Realm.  Which, it turns out, wasn't such a good idea after all.  The
Ocarina of Time is obtained from the moat outside Hyrule Castle, but only
appears there once you have obtained all three of the Spiritual Stones.

---------
Hookshot
First Found: Kakariko Graveyard
Used By: Adult Link

The Hookshot is Dampe's "Stretching, shrinking keepsake."  With it, you can
latch onto certain objects in the environment (mostly things made of wood, but
also special targets) and pull yourself up to it.  The Hookshot is also a
powerful ranged tool, and is able to penetrate certain hard armors (such as the
armor of the Big Skulltula).  It can also retrieve distant Skulltula Tokens in
the same fashion as the Boomerang.  It later replaced by the Longshot, which
features significantly increased range.  The Hookshot is found almost
immediately after Link enters adulthood, and is won from Dampe's Ghost
underneath his gravestone in Kakariko Graveyard.

----------
Fairy Bow
First Found: The Forest Temple
Used By: Adult Link

The most powerful ranged weapon in the game, the Fairy Bow is found quite early
in Adult Link's journey to awaken the Sages.  It is similar to the Fairy
Slingshot in function, and is in fact only different in it's amount of
strength.  The arrows that the Fairy Bow fires can be enhanced with the powers
of Fire, Ice and Light, to deal additional damage to enemies or solve other
puzzles.  The Fairy Bow is the dungeon item from The Forest Temple.

---------------
Megaton Hammer
First Found: The Fire Temple
Used By: Adult Link

Similar to the Biggoron Sword in terms of power, the Megaton Hammer is made
significantly less useful by it's extremely slow attack speed.  The Megaton
Hammer is used to solve numerous puzzles and defeat the Fire Temple's boss,
Volvagia, but otherwise it's existence is easily forgotten.  The Megaton Hammer
is the dungeon item from the Fire Temple.

---------
Longshot
First Found: The Water Temple
Used By: Adult Link

An upgraded version of the Hookshot, the Longshot is functionally the same but
has double the range.  The Longshot is the dungeon item from the Water Temple.

-----------
Fire Arrow
First Found: Lake Hylia
Used By: Adult Link

The first arrow enhancement you obtain, the Fire Arrow is also the most
frequently used.  The Fire Arrow can be used to light far off torches, or to
burn certain other objects (such as spider webs).  The Fire Arrow is also
required to defeat certain enemies.  To obtain them, complete the Water Temple,
then stand on the large island in south of Lake Hylia.  Wait for the sun to
rise (the Sun's Song won't work, you'll just have to wait for time to pass
normally), then fire an arrow into the sun.  The Fire Arrows will appear on the
smaller island.

--------------
Lens of Truth
First Found: The Bottom of the Well
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The Lens makes a small ring appear on the screen, and invisible objects or fake
(but visible) objects that pass into this ring are revealed for what they truly
are.  The Lens constantly drains a small amount of your magic meter while using
it, however rapidly turning the Lens on and off prevents the magic meter from
being drained.  The Lens of Truth is found by Young Link in the Bottom of the
Well, and though he has access to it, there is rarely cause for Young Link to
use it.  It is required to defeat the Shadow Temple's boss, as well as to
access the entrance to the Spirit Temple.

----------
Ice Arrow
First Found: The Gerudo Training Ground
Used By: Adult Link

The second arrow upgrade you can acquire, the Ice Arrows are completely
optional.  This is because the Ice Arrows have no real use in the game, though
they are incredibly powerful against Fire-based enemies.  It's just a shame
that you can't get the Ice Arrows until after you've beaten the Fire Temple.
The Ice Arrows are obtained from the Gerudo Training Ground by taking the left
door in the Treasure Room.

-------------
Nayru's Love
First Found: The Gerudo Training Ground
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The last, most powerful and most expensive of the three magic spells you obtain
from the Great Fairy of Magic, Nayru's Love makes you invulnerable for a period
of time (around a minute, I believe, but I haven't timed it).  You can get it
from a cave in the Desert Colossus just before entering the Spirit Temple,
which is good timing since the Iron Knuckles inside the Spirit Temple are
vicious competitors.  This item is particularly useful for Young Link, as he
must face both a Stalfos and an Iron Knuckle in the Spirit Temple's West Wing.

------------
Light Arrow
First Found: The Temple of Time
Used By: Adult Link

A gift from Princess Zelda when you finally find her near the end of the game,
the Light Arrows are the only weapons in all of Hyrule that can make Ganondorf
vulnerable to the power of the Master Sword.  The Light Arrows are also
required to destroy the Seals in Ganondorf's Keep.  The Light Arrows are given
to Link in the Temple of Time after he has obtained all six Medallions from the
Spiritual Sages.

----------------
Zelda's Lullaby
First Found: Hyrule Castle Garden
Sequence: C-Left, C-Up, C-Right, C-Left, C-Up, C-Right

Taught to you by Impa after you first meet Princess Zelda, Zelda's Lullaby is
easily the song you will play most throughout the game.  You need to use it to
access the Great Fairy Fountains, you must use it to open the door to Darunia's
Chamber, you must use it to enter Zora's Domain, you must use it to raise and
lower the water levels in the Water Temple... the list goes on.

-------------
Epona's Song (Young Link)
First Found: Lon Lon Ranch
Sequence: C-Up, C-Left, C-Right, C-Up, C-Left, C-Right

Taught to you by Malon in Lon Lon Ranch, Epona's Song has two primary
functions: one, it lets you ride Epona as Adult Link, and two, gets you free
milk from any cow in the game.  Learning this song is as optional as getting
Epona is.  If you can call significantly increased running speed in Hyrule
Field, free milk, and access to the fourth bottle "optional."

-------------
Saria's Song
First Found: Sacred Forest Meadow
Sequence: C-Down, C-Right, C-Left, C-Down, C-Right, C-Left

Taught to you by Saria when you visit her in the Sacred Forest Meadow, Saria's
Song is required to get Darunia to trust you, and is later needed to get past
Mido in the Lost Woods as Adult Link.  It also lets you telepathically
communicate with Saria at any time, who will generally give you vague hints
about where you should go next.  You can get through the whole game only
playing this song twice.

-----------
Sun's Song
First Found: Kakariko Graveyard - Royal Family's Tomb
Sequence: C-Right, C-Down, C-Up, C-Right, C-Down, C-Up

Learned in the Royal Family's Tomb in Kakariko Graveyard, the Sun's Song
alternates the time of day between 12:00 (noon) and 0:00 (midnight).  For this
reason, it is useless for obtaining sunrise or sunset, but works fine for
getting to daytime or nighttime.  In a zone where the passage of time is
normal, then it will work normally.  In a zone where the passage of time is
fixed, then you will be warped back to where you first entered the zone when
time changes.

-------------
Song of Time
First Found: Hyrule Field
Sequence: C-Right, A Button, C-Down, C-Right, A Button, C-Down

First taught to you by Zelda when you first obtain the Ocarina of Time, the
Song of Time is initially used to open the Door of Time in the Temple of Time.
Later on, as Adult Link, the Song of Time is used to interact with Blocks of
Time.  Arguably the most important song in the game, after Zelda's Lullaby.

---------------
Song of Storms
First Found: Kakariko Village - Windmill (Adult Link)
Sequence: A Button, C-Down, C-Up, A Button, C-Down, C-Up

Taught to Adult Link in the Windmill by the Organ Grinder, you must then use
the song to make the story that the Organ Grinder tells you come true.  The
Song of Storms is required to gain access to the Bottom of the Well dungeon as
Young Link, but this is it's only required used.  It can optionally be used to
fill the dried up oasis in Desert Colossus, and the storm it creates makes
crossing the Haunted Wasteland easier.

-----------------
Minuet of Forest
First Found: Sacred Forest Meadow
Sequence: A Button, C-Up, C-Left, C-Right, C-Left, C-Right

The first of the magical transportation songs that Adult Link learns, the
Minuet of Forest is taught to Link by Sheik when he reaches the back of the
Sacred Forest Meadow.  The Minuet transports Link (Young or Adult) to the
Sacred Forest Meadow at any time, giving easy access to the Forest Temple and a
nearby Fairy Fountain.

---------------
Bolero of Fire
First Found: Death Mountain Crater
Sequence: C-Down, A Button, C-Down, A Button, C-Right, C-Down, C-Right, C-Down

The third of the magical transportation songs that Adult Link can learn, the
Bolero of Fire is taught to Link by Sheik when he reaches the bottom level of
the Death Mountain Crater (use the door in Darunia's Chamber).  The Bolero
transports Link (Young or Adult) to Death Mountain Crater, giving easy access
to the Fire Temple.  Young Link must use the transportation song to reach one
of the most cunningly hidden earth patches in the game.

------------------
Serenade of Water
First Found: Ice Cavern
Sequence: A Button, C-Down, C-Right, C-Right, C-Left

The fourth of the magical transportation songs that Adult Link can learn, the
Serenade of Fire is taught to Link by Sheik after he obtains the Iron Boots
from the Ice Cavern.  The Serenade transports Link (Young or Adult) to Lake
Hylia, giving easy access to the Water Temple.

------------------
Requiem of Spirit
First Found: Desert Colossus
Sequence: A Button, C-Down, A Button, C-Right, C-Down, A Button

The sixth of the magical transportation songs that Adult Link can learn, the
Requiem of Spirit is taught to Link by Sheik after he enters, and then leaves
the Spirit Temple and returns to the Desert Colossus.  The Requiem transports
Link (Young or Adult) to the Desert Colossus, giving easy access to the Spirit
Temple.  Young Link must use this song to access to the Spirit Temple, since
the Gerudo Thieves won't let him cross the bridge into the Fortress.  Another
patch of soft earth is found in the Colossus.

-------------------
Nocturne of Shadow
First Found: Kakariko Village
Sequence: C-Left, C-Right, C-Right, A Button, C-Left, C-Right, C-Down

The fifth of the magical transportation songs that Adult Link can learn, the
Nocturne of Shadow is taught to Link by Sheik after he finishes the Forest,
Fire and Water Temple and enters Kakariko Village.  The Nocturne transports
Link (Young or Adult) to the high ledge in Kakariko Graveyard.  This is the
ONLY way to reach the Shadow Temple.

-----------------
Prelude of Light
First Found: The Temple of Time
Sequence: C-Up, C-Right, C-Up, C-Right, C-Left, C-Up

The second of the magical transportation songs that Adult Link can learn, the
Prelude of Light is taught to Link by Sheik after he finishes the Forest Temple
and returns to the Temple of Time.  The Prelude of Light transports Link (Young
or Adult) to the Temple of Time, making travel between Adulthood and Childhood
a quick and painless task.

---------------------
The Scarecrow's Song
First Found: Lake Hylia
Sequence: Player's Choice

A hidden song, the Scarecrow's Song is taught by the player to one of the
scarecrows in Lake Hylia by Young Link.  You can make up any song you like,
with a few requirements: it can't be any of the other songs in the game, it
must contain eight notes, and it must contain at least two different notes.  I
prefer to do C-Down, C-Right, C-Left, C-Up, C-Down, C-Right, C-Left, C-Up, but
you can do whatever song you like.

Once you have become Adult Link, return to Lake Hylia and play the Scarecrow
the same song you played as Young Link.  The Scarecrow will "remember" the
Song, and the Scarecrow's Song can now be played at various places around
Hyrule to make Pierre the Scarecrow appear.  Pierre can be used as a makeshift
Hookshot target.  The Scarecrow's Song is required to reach a number of Gold
Skulltulas in the game, and also makes shortcuts to other areas of the game.

-------------
Kokiri Sword
First Found: Kokiri Forest
Used By: Young Link

The weakest sword in the game, the Kokiri Sword has an extremely limited range.
It is used only by Young Link.  Even in the hands of the diminutive Young Link,
the Kokiri Sword feels more like a long knife then an actual sword.  Found in
the back of the Kokiri Training Ground, the Kokiri Sword is one of the items
that Mido requires you to find before you can meet the Deku Tree.

-------------
Master Sword
First Found: The Temple of Time
Used By: Adult Link

The second-most powerful sword in the game, the Master Sword significantly
increases the range of the Kokiri Sword.  However, it's so big that Young Link
can't wield it (and besides, it's too powerful magically for him to handle it
anyway).  The main weapon used by Adult Link, it is preferred for most of the
basic fights thanks to the fact that you can pair it with the Hylian or Mirror
Shield.  But in situations where a shield is useless (such as boss fights), the
Biggoron Sword is preferred.

--------------
Giant's Knife
First Found: Goron City
Used By: Adult Link

Purchased for two hundred rupees from the Biggoron stashed away in the back of
Goron City, the Giant's Knife is poorly crafted and will break when used.
Though the Giant's Knife loses all of it's range when this happens (it's range,
in fact, becomes less then the Kokiri Sword when shattered), it loses none of
it's power, which is on par with the Biggoron Sword.

---------------
Biggoron Sword
First Found: Death Mountain Trail
Used By: Adult Link

The ultimate reward for finishing the Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest, the
Biggoron Sword is identical to the Giant's Knife.  Only the Biggoron who crafts
this one is actually a competent swordsmith, so it won't shatter when used.
For information on completing the Biggoron Sword Trading Sidequest, see the
Walkthroughs and Sidequests chapter.  The Biggoron Sword is so large that a
shield cannot be wielded while using it.  It's large size also makes it
unwieldy to use in small corridors.  The Master Sword is preferred for fights
with basic enemies, but in fights where a shield is useless (such as in boss
fights), the Biggoron Sword is the weapon of choice.

------------
Deku Shield
First Found: Kokiri Forest
Used By: Young Link

Purchased from the Kokiri Shop for forty rupees, this is the other item that
Mido requires you to get before he'll let you visit the Deku Tree.  The Deku
Shield is made of sturdy wood, and though it cannot be shattered by force it is
easily burned by fire.  The Deku Shield is small enough that Young Link can use
it like an actual shield, unlike the Hylian Shield.  The Deku Shield can be
purchased and found in several areas throughout the game, which is helpful
since it is so easily lost in fire-based environments.

--------------
Hylian Shield
First Found: Kakariko Graveyard
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The Hylian Shield is made of metal (probably steel), and does not have the
weakness to fire that the Deku Shield has.  This makes it a worthy replacement
for Young Link when in fire-based environments (such as Dodongo's Cavern), but
the shield is so large that Link can't wield it normally.  Instead, it straps
to his back, and Young Link rolls up into a turtle-like position for defense.
Though you can't move, you're essentially invulnerable while in this position.
Once you reach adulthood, then Adult Link can wield the shield normally along
with the Master Sword.

One of your first opportunities to acquire the shield is underneath one of the
gravestones in Kakariko Graveyard, though you can also purchase it from the
Bazaar in Hyrule Castle Market and Kakariko Village later on.  Hylian Shields
are easily stolen by Like-Likes, so be careful when combating these foes.
Though most people don't realize it, you can actually avoid the Hylian Shield
and finish most of Adult Link's quest without ever getting it.  Why you'd want
to do this is beyond me, but keep it in mind if you're looking for a challenge.

--------------
Mirror Shield
First Found: Spirit Temple, East Wing
Used By: Adult Link

A replacement for the Hylian Shield which comes very late in the game, the
Mirror Shield is a highly-polished shield.  It's surface can reflect beams of
light to other areas of the room, which is required to solve certain puzzles.
The Mirror Shield can also reflect Twinrova's magic beams, which is the only
way to defeat that boss.  The best thing about the Mirror Shield is that it
cannot be stolen by Like-Likes.

-------------
Kokiri Tunic
First Found: Default
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The standard clothing worn by Link, the Kokiri Tunic is green in color and has
no enhancements.  You begin the game wearing this tunic, and it's the only
tunic in the game which cannot be lost.

------------
Goron Tunic
First Found: Goron City
Used By: Adult Link

The Goron Tunic is made from Goron Skin, and is highly resistant to heat.  When
worn, Link becomes invulnerable to the overwhelming heat of Death Mountain
Crater and the Fire Temple.  In essence, it cancels the time limit you have to
remain in these areas.  A free Goron Tunic is given to you after you meet Link
the Goron in Goron City.  Additional tunics can be purchased from the Goron
Shop for 300 rupees (which means you'll need the Giant's Wallet).  The Goron
Tunic is red in color, and can be stolen by a Like-Like.  You don't really have
a choice obtaining the Goron Tunic... but you do have the choice of wearing it.

-----------
Zora Tunic
First Found: Zora's Domain
Used By: Adult Link

The Zora Tunic is made from Zora Skin, and allows the wearer to breath
underwater in the same manner that the Zora do.  In essence, it cancels the
time limit you have to remain underwater while wearing the Iron Boots.  A free
Zora Tunic is given to you by King Zora after unfreezing him from the Red Ice
(use a bottle of Blue Fire).  Additional tunics can be purchased from the Zora
Shop for 300 rupees (which means you'll need the Giant's Wallet).  You'll have
to unfreeze the door to the Zora Shop the same way you unfroze the King Zora.
The Zora Tunic is blue in color, and can be stolen by a Like-Like.  Unlike the
Goron Tunic, obtaining the Zora Tunic is entirely optional.

-------------
Kokiri Boots
First Found: Default
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The default boots that you begin the game with, the Kokiri Boots have good
traction and react the way you would expect boots to act.  They cannot be
stolen by Like-Likes.

-----------
Iron Boots
First Found: Ice Cavern
Used By: Adult Link

Found in the Ice Cavern, the Iron Boots are needed in the Water Temple.  While
worn, it forces Link to the sink to the bottom of pools of water.  While on dry
ground, the Iron Boots force Link to move very slowly, but he becomes
invulnerable to strong gusts of wind from the fans in certain dungeons.  While
on the floor of pools of water, speed is increased, but still not on par with
Kokiri Boots.

------------
Hover Boots
First Found: Shadow Temple
Used By: Adult Link

The Hover Boots can be used to run over a pit as though it were solid ground
for one second.  Their usefulness is limited (easily the most underutilized
item in the game).  Hover Boots increase the effects of gusts of wind in the
same way that Iron Boots decrease the effect.  While wearing the Hover Boots,
running around on solid ground is like running around on ice.

-----------------------------------------------
Fairy Slingshot Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #1
First Found: Inside the Deku Tree
Used By: Young Link

Found along with the Fairy Slingshot, this ammunition pouch holds 30 Deku Seeds
(the Slingshot's preferred ammunition).  This is the smallest ammo pouch, and
is quickly upgraded after finishing the dungeon.

-----------------------------------------------
Fairy Slingshot Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #2
First Found: Hyrule Castle Market
Used By: Young Link

The first upgrade to the slingshot ammunition capacity is found in Hyrule
Castle Market.  Near the back of the Market there is a building with a target
above the door.  This is the Shooting Range.  Go inside.

Speak with the rather large and hairy clerk, and agree to play the game.  To
win the Fairy Slingshot Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #2, you have to shoot every
rupee that appears without missing a single one.  If you miss two or less, then
the clerk will let you try again for free.  If you miss more then two, you have
to pay to play again.

For this first run through the Shooting Gallery, the rupees appear in a preset
order.  The order is:

1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Keep playing the minigame until you successfully shoot all of the targets, and
the clerk will award you with the first Bullet Bag  upgrade, which increases
the ammo capacity of your Slingshot by 10.  If you run out of rupees trying to
complete the game, then return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse and smash the
pots to replenish your supplies.

-----------------------------------------------
Fairy Slingshot Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #3
First Found: Lost Woods
Used By: Young Link

The last Slingshot Ammunition upgrade is found in the southeast corner of Lost
Woods.  Hanging above the valley where the Twin Skullkids dance, there is a
drum hanging from a tree.  Shoot the center of this drum three times in a row
(a large "100" appears when you hit it in the correct place), and a Deku Scrub
will appear and give you the upgrade.

-----------------------------------------
Fairy Bow Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #1
First Found: The Forest Temple
Used By: Adult Link

Found along with the Fairy Bow, this arrow quiver holds 30 arrows.  This is the
smallest quiver, and is quickly upgraded after finishing the dungeon.

-----------------------------------------
Fairy Bow Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #2
First Found: Kakariko Village
Used By: Adult Link

In the future, Kakariko Village is now fully constructed and the shops from
Hyrule Castle Market have relocated here.  Including the shooting gallery.
This shooting game is identical to the Shooting Gallery from Link's childhood,
only now the order is completely random.  Keep playing the game until you nail
all of the targets in one go, and the clerk will reward you with the first
Quiver upgrade.  Cherish it, as it will be the only Quiver upgrade you get
until almost the end of the game.

The order is as follows:
1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Note number 2: if a single blue rupee comes from the left, then the next one
will ALWAYS come from the right, despite the randomness of the rest of it.
Keep this in mind.  Also, if you memorize the patterns that the targets appear
in, then you can predict what will appear next, and you can always tell what
the last pattern will be by simply looking at what has already appeared.

-----------------------------------------
Fairy Bow Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #3
First Found: Gerudo Fortress
Used By: Adult Link

The second Quiver upgrade is found in the Gerudo Fortress, after obtaining the
Gerudo's Card and becoming an official Gerudo Thief.  Riding on Epona, head for
the Horseback Archery Range on the east side of the Fortress and speak with the
Gerudo Lieutenant standing there.  The Quiver can only be won after obtaining
the Piece of Heart from the same minigame.

The Gerudo Archery Range is by far the hardest shooting range in the game,
though if you managed to do the Big Poe Hunting sidequest then it shouldn't be
much of a problem.  You get twenty arrows to use, and in order to win the Piece
of Heart from this game you must score at least 1,000 points.  There are huge
wooden targets set up along the course as well pots that appear on the way.
Shoot the pots for 100 points each, and the targets are worth varying amounts
depending upon how close to the center you are (the exact middle of the target
is worth 100 points).

Epona will automatically run up and down the course (you get one pass in each
direction before the game ends).  On your first pass, focus on hitting the pots
as you pass by them.  Once you nail all the pots, focus on the target on the
far north side of the course.  On your second pass, shoot for the targets on
the east side of the course until you get near enough to accurately hit the
target on the south side of the course.  Once you do get near enough, aim for
it.

Once you score 1,000 points, you'll win the Piece of Heart.  Play the game
again and score at least 1,500 to earn the Quiver.  If you score 1,500 or more
on your first attempt, then you have to play again to earn the Quiver and
repeat the feat.  Sorry, that's just how it works.  You don't get anything for
scoring a perfect 2,000, aside from a hearty pat on the back.

------------------------------------
Bomb Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #1
First Found: Dodongo's Cavern
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

This is the default Bomb Bag that you get along with the Bombs in Dodongo's
Cavern.  It holds only twenty bombs, but can quickly be upgraded to the maximum
level as soon as you are finished with the dungeon.

------------------------------------
Bomb Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #2
First Found: Goron City
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The first available Bomb Bag upgrade is in Goron City.  Drop down to the third
level of the city (the level directly beneath the top floor), where there is a
Biggoron rolling around the level in a giant loop.  You can stop him by placing
a bomb in his path so that it explodes just as he passes over it.  If you do
this while he is passing through the tunnel in the northern part of the third
floor, then he will give you the Bomb Bag x30 as a reward for your daring.

------------------------------------
Bomb Ammunition Capacity Upgrade #3
First Found: Hyrule Castle Market
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The final Bomb Bag upgrade can be earned immediately after you get the first
upgrade.  Head for Hyrule Castle Market, and go to the newly-opened Bombchu
Bowling Alley (it opens after you finish Dodongo's Cavern).  In addition to the
Bomb Bag, you can also win: Bombs, Bombchus, a Purple Rupee, and a Piece of
Heart.  Just keep playing the game until the clerk offers you the Bomb Bag as a
reward.

The object of Bombchu Bowling is to send the Bombchu (a mobile bomb) into the
hole on the opposite end of the course.  The course has three different goals
to obtain, each one becoming progressively more difficult.  Completing all
three goals successfully will win you whatever prize the clerk showed you at
the start.

For the first goal, the target is always in the center of the field.  Simply
stand in the exact middle of the field (slightly to the right of the center
arrow is the exact middle of the field) and time it so your Bombchu avoids the
Blade Trap.  The next level of the field can be on the top, left, or right, and
adds a small Cucco to dodge.  The Cucco isn't as predictable as the Blade Trap
in it's movements, but is so small it almost isn't an issue.  The last goal is
always in the exact center, and adds a Fat Cucco who always stands roughly in
the center of the field (but you can sneak a Bombchu by it if you're careful).

When you're playing Bombchu Bowling, always position yourself in the center of
the field.  The one exception is when the target appears on the right in the
second round; you have to minorly adjust your position to the left or right,
otherwise it's impossible to angle yourself properly for the Bombchu to enter
the target.  If the hole appears on the left side of the field, then adjust
your angle so that the Bombchu goes along the floor, then the wall, then into
the hole.  For holes in the center or top of the playing field, simply wait
until all of the targets are in the right position, and send a Bombchu straight
down the middle.  Absolutely never play anywhere except in the exact center of
the field (again, except for when the target appears on the right in the second
round).  Bombchu Bowling is, ultimately, more a game of patience and timing
then luck.

---------------
Goron Bracelet
First Found: Goron Bracelet
Used By: Young Link

The Goron Bracelet is a gift to Young Link from Darunia, after cheering him up
with Saria's Song.  The Goron Bracelet increases Young Link's strength, giving
him the ability to pluck Bomb Flowers from the ground.  He can also pick up
weeds... not that you will ever have to.

-----------------
Silver Gauntlets
First Found: Spirit Temple, West Wing
Used By: Adult Link

Obtained late in the adventure, the Silver Gauntlets are found by Young Link,
though only Adult Link can use them.  Once he has the Silver Gauntlets, then he
can push and pull the huge blue blocks that appear in the Spirit Temple and
Gerudo Training Ground.

---------------
Gold Gauntlets
First Found: Ganon's Castle
Used By: Adult Link

The second-to-last thing which can be obtained in the game, the Gold Gauntlets
are used a grand total of three times in the adventure.  With the Gold
Gauntlets, Link can lift up the black obelisks that appear in Ganon's Castle
and throw them aside.  One of the black obelisks hides the game's last Fairy
Fountain, another hides a door in the Keep, and the last is needed to finish
the Fire Seal.

-------------
Silver Scale
First Found: Zora's Domain
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The Silver Scale doubles Link's diving depth from 3 meters to 6 meters.  It is
required to obtain the game's third bottle and access Zora's Fountain.  The
Silver Scale is won from the diving minigame at the top of the Zora's Domain
waterfall.  Go left through the tunnel in King Zora's throne room to reach it.

The Diving Minigame is relatively easy.  The Zora will throw a handful of
rupees off the waterfall, which you need to dive down and grab.  Simply
position yourself above the rupees, and hold down A as you dive down to grab
them.  Once you get better at it, you can grab multiple rupees in one dive.
Once you have grabbed all of the rupees from around the waterfall, the Zora
will call down for you to return to him and he'll give you a reward.  He'll
give you the Silver Scale, which doubles how deep you can go in a single dive.

-----------
Gold Scale
First Found: Lake Hylia
Used By: Young Link, Adult Link

The Gold Scale increases Link's diving depth to nine meters, it's maximum
length.  You get it around the same time as you get the Iron Boots, which makes
it's use limited (or indeed, obsolete).  But, the Gold Scale is required to get
one of the more elusive Pieces of Heart in the game, so it's worth getting.
The Gold Scale is won from the Fishing Pond with Adult Link, though Young Link
can benefit from it's effects as well.

In order to win the Gold Scale, you have to capture a record breaking fish:
fifteen pounds.  There really isn't much advice that can be given for this.
It's all about patience.  Z-Target a fish, then hit B to cast.  Use the B
button, the A button and the joystick to play with the lure and attract fish to
the fly.  The biggest fish are found near the submerged log on the left side of
the pond and the reeds on the right.  Once a fish is on the line, hold down A
and pull backwards on the control stick to reel the fish in.  With that
information in hand, get fishing.

The fish now are much larger as Adult Link, and can therefore break free of the
line much easier.  There isn't much you can do about this.  If it happens, then
it happens.  The unfortunate downside to this is that once a fish breaks free
from the line, it disappears permanently.  If the pond starts running low on
larger fish, then leave it and re-enter, and they will respawn.  I find it also
helps to alternate between holding back and to the left, and back and to the
right every few seconds while you reel the fish in.

------
Epona
First Found: Lon Lon Ranch
Used By: Adult Link

Epona is won from Lon Lon Ranch, and can be obtained immediately after becoming
Adult Link (it can, and should, be your first task as Adult Link).  First,
you're going to need Epona's Song, so if you didn't learn that as Young Link
then you'll have to visit Lon Lon Ranch in the past and learn it.  This means
that you'll have to finish the first dungeon before you can return to the past.

Run into the ranch and speak with Ingo.  He'll rant about what a victim he is,
and how great Ganondorf is.  He'll then offer to let you ride one of the
horses.  Pay him 10 rupees, and when you enter the paddock, ignore the horse
that Ingo offers you.  Play Epona's Song, and the now fully-grown Epona will
run towards you.  Aim Epona at one of the fences in the course, then begin
tapping A to feed her carrots and move forward.  Jump over both of the fences
in the course to make back your ten rupees, then speak with Ingo.

Tell Ingo that you want to quit riding.  Once you are back outside the paddock,
speak with Ingo again and tell him that you want to ride again.  Get on Epona
again, then ride over both fences again to make back your money.  Now, speak
with Ingo WHILE you are riding Epona (z-target him to make it easier), and Ingo
will challenge you to a race for 50 rupees.  Accept the challenge.

Defeat Ingo by getting in front of him, and carefully steering Epona so that
you stay in front of his path.  Alternatively, you can also use a steady amount
of carrots and hug the inside the rail.  Use your first four carrots quickly,
then wait for one to regenerate, then use another carrot, then wait for it to
regenerate, then use another, etc. etc.

Defeat Ingo, and he'll challenge you to another race.  And this time, if you
win, he'll let you keep Epona.  Agree.  On this race, Ingo will cheat, and
start a second before the clock says Go.  Because you're the good guy, you
don't get this luxury.  Repeat the same strategy you used to beat him last
time; hug the inside rail, and use a steady amount of carrots, or get in front
of him and keep him from progressing.  The only thing harder about this race is
Ingo cheats.  He tends to take the corners very wide, so that's your
opportunity to move in front of him.

Once you defeat Ingo for the second time, he'll honor his bet, but he'll also
prevent you from leaving the Ranch by closing the gate.  To make it over the
gate, you must run around the path around the paddock in a counter-clockwise
pattern.  Once you come around the corner and see the gate, burn all of your
carrots at once and charge straight at the gate.  It can take a few tries
before you can coax Epona over; this is as much about luck as it is about aim.
Once you make it over the gate, then you will return to Hyrule Field and Epona
will become yours.

------------------
Super Spin Attack
First Found: Death Mountain Trail

This upgrade increases the range of Link's Spin Attack by a wide margin, and
gives it two charge levels.  The first level, blue, doubles the range of the
Spin Attack, and the second level, red, triples the range.  Damage dealt is not
increased.  The Super Spin Attack isn't a required ability to beat the game,
and indeed once you get it you'll probably forget you have it.  You can quickly
execute a blue level Super Spin Attack by rotating the joystick and pressing
the attack button.  Both levels of the Super Spin Attack use a small amount of
the magic meter.  If you like, you can still execute a standard Spin Attack by
holding down the B-Button, and releasing it just as the sword glows blue.  The
spin attack will execute, but will not use any Magic Power.

The Super Spin Attack is obtained from the Great Fairy of Power on the peak of
Death Mountain.  Use a bomb to blow open the odd formation of rock to the left
of the entrance to Death Mountain Crater to find the entrance to the fountain.

--------------------
Magic Meter Upgrade
First Found: Death Mountain Crater

The Magic Meter Upgrade doubles the size of the Magic Meter.  It is obtained
from the Great Fairy of Power, who resides behind a pair of silver rocks in the
lower half of Death Mountain Crater.  Use the Megaton Hammer to smash the rocks
blocking the entrance to the cave.  You can just see the doorway behind the
rocks, even when they are not destroyed.

----------------
Defense Upgrade
First Found: Ganon's Castle

A gift from the Great Fairy of Courage, who lives near the bridge of light that
leads into Ganon's Castle.  To access the fountain, you have to have the Gold
Gauntlet.  Head down the path behind the shattered arch, where you will find
one of the game's black obelisks.  Pick it up and toss it aside to gain access
to the fountain.

-------------------------------
Deku Stick Capacity Upgrade #1
First Found: Lost Woods

The first Deku Stick Upgrade can be obtained as soon as the game begins.  A
Business Scrub in the southwest valley of the Lost Woods sells he upgrade for
forty rupees.  It raises your Deku Stick capacity from 10 to 20 (and also maxes
your Deku Sticks).

-------------------------------
Deku Stick Capacity Upgrade #2
First Found: Forest Stage

The second Deku Stick Upgrade can be obtained from the Forest Stage, but
requires the Skull Mask.  The Forest Stage is located in the clearing near the
center of the Lost Woods.  Head for the back of the clearing, where you will
find a cluster of butterflies hovering around the tall grass.  Near the
butterflies, there is a pit which leads to the Forest Stage.  Drop down into
the Forest Stage, equip the Skull Mask, and stand on the platform before the
Deku Scrubs.  They'll award you with the Deku Stick upgrade, which raises your
capacity to 30.

-----------------------------
Deku Nut Capacity Upgrade #1
First Found: Lost Woods

The first Deku Nut Upgrade is found in the Lost Woods.  Use a bomb to blow up
the rock near the entrance to the Sacred Forest Meadow, and in the pit below
you'll find a pair of Business Scrubs.  One of them sells the upgrade for forty
rupees.

-----------------------------
Deku Nut Capacity Upgrade #2
First Found: Forest Stage

The second Deku Nut Upgrade is can be gotten in the Forest Stage, but requires
the Mask of Truth.  The Forest Stage is located in the clearing near the center
of the Lost Woods.  Head for the back of the clearing, where you will find a
cluster of butterflies hovering around the tall grass.  Near the butterflies,
there is a pit which leads to the Forest Stage.  Drop down into the Forest
Stage, equip the Mask of Truth, and stand on the platform before the Deku
Scrubs.  The Scrubs will stare at you.  Run over and speak with their leader
(the tall one with the mustache), and he'll give you the Deku Nut upgrade.

This upgrade is unobtainable if you travel to Adulthood before getting it.

---------------
Child's Wallet

---------------
Stone of Agony
First Found: House of Skulltula

A reward from the House of Skulltula for killing twenty Gold Skulltulas and
taking their tokens, the Stone of Agony works in conjunction with the rumble
pak to reveal hidden pits.  When you pass over one of these pits, the pak will
rumble slightly.  This item is not required to finish the game, but getting all
of the Gold Skulltulas and Heart Pieces would be a significantly harder
accomplishment without it.

--------------
Gerudo's Card
First Found: Gerudo Fortress

The membership card for the Gerudo Thieves, the Gerudo's Card is obtained after
you free the four carpenters from the Fortress (which can be done as early as
when you first get the Hookshot, though it's easier with the Bow).  The
Gerudo's Card stops the Gerudo Guards from throwing you in jail, and also lets
you access the Haunted Wasteland, the Gerudo Training Ground and the Horseback
Archery Range.

Goal: Buy from Business Scrub near Lake Hylia entrance

Requires: Bombs

Head for the fenced-in square near the entrance to Lake Hylia.  Jump into the
middle of the fences, and head for the approximate center.  Use a Bomb to blast

Heart Piece #1 [HP01]
Goal: Return the Lost Dog to it's owner
Time Period: Young Link ONLY
Requires: Nothing

Enter Hyrule Castle Market at nighttime.  Use the Sun's Song if you have it,
otherwise wait around Hyrule Castle Garden until nighttime then re-enter the
Market.  Look for a small white dog behind a stall near the entrance to the
Gate.  Run near it so that it follows you, then enter the back alley near the
entrance to the Treasure Chest Game.  Enter the second door on the left and
speak with the fat lady inside.  She'll recognize the dog as her own, and
reward you with a Piece of Heart.

----------------------
Heart Piece #2 [HP10]
Goal: Win in Bombchu Bowling Alley
Time Period: Young Link ONLY
Requires: Nothing

Keep playing the Bombchu Bowling Alley game until the Piece of Heart is offered
up as a prize.

The object of Bombchu Bowling is to send the Bombchu (a mobile bomb) into the
hole on the opposite end of the course.  The course has three different goals
to obtain, each one becoming progressively more difficult.  Completing all
three goals successfully will win you whatever prize the clerk showed you at
the start.

For the first goal, the target is always in the center of the field.  Simply
stand in the exact middle of the field (slightly to the right of the center
arrow is the exact middle of the field) and time it so your Bombchu avoids the
Blade Trap.  The next level of the field can be on the top, left, or right, and
adds a small Cucco to dodge.  The Cucco isn't as predictable as the Blade Trap
in it's movements, but is so small it almost isn't an issue.  The last goal is
always in the exact center, and adds a Fat Cucco who always stands roughly in
the center of the field (but you can sneak a Bombchu by it if you're careful).

When you're playing Bombchu Bowling, always position yourself in the center of
the field.  The one exception is when the target appears on the right in the
second round; you have to minorly adjust your position to the left or right,
otherwise it's impossible to angle yourself properly for the Bombchu to enter
the target.  If the hole appears on the left side of the field, then adjust
your angle so that the Bombchu goes along the floor, then the wall, then into
the hole.  For holes in the center or top of the playing field, simply wait
until all of the targets are in the right position, and send a Bombchu straight
down the middle.  Absolutely never play anywhere except in the exact center of
the field (again, except for when the target appears on the right in the second
round).  Bombchu Bowling is, ultimately, more a game of patience and timing
then luck.

----------------------
Heart Piece #3 [HP32]
Goal: Win the Treasure Chest Game
Time Period: Young Link ONLY
Requires: Nothing (Lens of Truth strongly recommended)

Enter the Treasure Chest Game near the entrance to the Back Alley in Hyrule
Castle Market (it's only open at night).  Speak with the clerk, and pay the fee
to play the game.  He'll give you a Small Key, which you can use to open the
first door.  Go through it.  There are two chests in this room, one of which
contains a Small Key, the other of which contains a Rupee.  The Key lets you
progress, the rupee is a booby prize.  Normally, you'd have to guess which
chest contains the Key.  But the Lens of Truth makes things easier.  Simply use
the Lens of Truth to see the contents of each chest, and take the Small Key in
each room.  When you reach the last room in the minigame, you will find a lone
chest which contains a Piece of Heart.

You can actually complete this minigame as soon as you access Hyrule Castle.
But the chances of making it all the way through the game without the Lens is
one in thirty two.  Which is three hundred and twenty rupees and several
tedious hours.  And that's not even a guarantee.  It could take LONGER.  Some
people might have that kind of patience, but I'm not one of them, and I'm
fairly positive most would agree with me.

Heart Piece #1 [HP06]
Goal: Retrieve from under Gravestone in the rear row.
Time Period: Young Link OR Adult Link
Requires: Fairy Ocarina OR Ocarina of Time; Sun's Song

Pull aside the Gravestones in the rear of Kakariko Graveyard.  One of them has
a pit underneath it.  Drop into this pit, and kill the Redead inside.  Play the
Sun's Song, and a chest appears which contains the Piece of Heart.

----------------------
Heart Piece #2 [HP07]
Goal: Win from the Heart-Pounding Grave Digging Tour
Time Period: Young Link ONLY
Requires: Nothing

From nightfall to 10:00, Dampe will operate a Grave Digging Minigame in the
Graveyard.  Dampe takes a circular route around the graveyard, following the
path.  If you stand directly in his path, then he will stop.  In one of the
twelve dirt patches dotted around the graveyard, there is hidden a Piece of
Heart.  In order to find the Piece of Heart, stand directly on that dirt patch
so that way Dampe will stop directly in front of it, then speak to Dampe and
pay him 10 rupees to dig up that patch of dirt.  Most of the dirt patches
contain at the very least some rupees.  Keep playing the game until you dig up
the Piece of Heart.  The Piece of Heart randomly changes places every time you
leave the zone, so if you have to leave to restock on Rupees, then just start
over from the beginning.

The game only operates from nightfall to 10:00, so you can't use the Sun's Song
to access it.  You'll have to return to Hyrule Field or Death Mountain Trail
and wait for the wolf's howl that indicates nightfall, then return to Kakariko
Graveyard.

----------------------
Heart Piece #3 [HP18]
Goal: Use Magic Leaf to reach Heart Piece
Time Period: Young Link AND Adult Link
Requires: Magic Beans

As Young Link, plant a Magic Bean in the patch of soft earth on the west side

Leaf up to a high ledge.  Roll into the crate on the ledge to find a Piece of
Heart.

----------------------
Heart Piece #4 [HP31]
Goal: Complete Dampe's Cave Race Minigame in under 1:00
Time Period: Adult Link ONLY
Requires: Longshot

Dampe's Cave Race Game can be found underneath a gravestone on the left side of
Kakariko Graveyard.  It's the only gravestone with flowers growing on it.  Drop
down the pit underneath the grave.

Step forward a few feet to find the ghost of Dampe.  He will challenge you to a
race, and will start without notice.  Immediately run forward, dodging the
flames that Dampe drops (he'll drop them the entire race - keep an eye out for
them).  Turn right at the halls end, taking the corner tight to dodge a flame.
Turn left at the next corner, taking the turn wide to dodge another flame.

Run forward between the pair of flames, running along the left side of the gap.
Turn left and then right immediately on the other side, taking the turn wide to
dodge another flame.  Turn right, then left, then left again, taking the turn
tight.  Take another tight turn on the other side, and go through the door.

Take a right on the other side, and another right, and then a wide left.  Run
along the left or right side of the tunnel, then enter the wide room.  Go
through the door on the right.  Take a left, then a wide right, then through
another door.  Run to the wall on the other side, then a right, then a tight
left.

Jump onto the ledge to your left, and hug the left wall as you run forward to
dodge more flames.  Take a wide left, then a tight left to enter a tall room
with a large pit in the middle.  Use the Longshot to latch onto one of the
torches near the top of the room, and pull yourself up.  If you make it under
one minute, then Dampe will give you a Piece of Heart for your efforts.

up the Bomb Flower and threw it down to blow open the entrance to Dodongo's
Cavern.  Stand in the small alcove with the Bomb Flower, and do a backflip over
the shortened bit of fence.  You'll land on the cliff below.  Alternatively,
you can plant the Magic Beans near the entrance to Dodongo's Cavern as Young
Link, then return as Adult Link and ride the Magic Leaf up to the Heart Piece.

Heart Piece #1 [HP23]
Goal: Get from cliff wall on upper level of Crater
Time Period: Young Link OR Adult Link
Requires: Nothing; Goron Tunic Strongly Recommended

You can actually get this Piece of Heart with Young Link, but you're going to
be pushing it.  Without the aid of the Goron Tunic, Young Link is susceptible
to the extreme heat of Death Mountain Crater.  If you fail to reach the Piece
of Heart before time runs out, then you will DIE.  Fairies don't help you.
You're dead.

The Heart Piece can be found in an alcove halfway down the cliff on the north
side of Death Mountain Crater.  Climb down the cliff and approach the alcove
from below to get the Piece of Heart.  If you try to drop into the alcove from
above, you'll fall into the lava, whereupon you will DIE.  If you're getting
this as Young Link, then I strongly recommend you just Save and Quit rather
then try to beat the clock back out of the Crater.

----------------------
Heart Piece #2 [HP24]
Goal: Use Magic Leaf to Reach Heart Piece
Time Period: Young Link AND Adult Link
Requires: Bolero of Fire; Magic Beans; Goron Tunic and Prelude of Light
Strongly Recommended

As Young Link, play the Bolero of Fire to warp to Death Mountain Crater.  There
is a patch of soft earth just to your left as you warp in.  Plant the Magic
Beans, then either save and quit out or use the Prelude of Light to return to
the Temple of Time.  Go forward in time to Adult Link, and return to Death
Mountain Crater.  Use the Magic Leaf to ride around to the Piece of Heart,
which is on top of one of the massive rocks near the warp-in point.

Time Period: Young Link ONLY

Use a Deku Stick to transfer the flame from Darunia's Room to the torches
around the bottom floor of Goron City.  Once all of the torches are lit, then
the large pot will begin to spin.  Run up to the next level of Goron City so
that you are level with the top of the pot.  Throw a bomb into the pot, and
when it explodes the pot will stop spinning.  If the pot stops with the happy
face pointing forward, then a Piece of Heart will appear.  Jump down to the
bottom floor to get it.

is matched with the A Button, and the remaining four frogs in the cross-shape
are matched to each direction on the C-Pad.  You've got to go fast.  VERY fast.
Ridiculously fast.  It takes practice, and persistence.  Memorizing the order
is very helpful.  Luckily, I have transcribed the order for you.

The order is as follows:

Light it with your Deku Stick, and quickly run back down the stairs and light
the torch you find there with the Deku Stick.  Pull out a new Deku Stick, and
light it again.

Run down the stone path, and take the first left down the path.  Light the
burned-out brazier next to the cave mouth around the corner, and keep going
forward through the shallow water to light another brazier.  Run to the left to
a small alcove behind the waterfall, where there are two more braziers.  Use
Din's Fire to light them both, or use the Deku Stick if you like.  If you did
it fast enough so that you lit all the braziers without any of them burning
out, then a chest will appear behind the Waterfall which contains a Piece of
Heart.

As Young Link, go to the Fishing Pond in Lake Hylia.  Speak with the Clerk to
the right, and pay him 20 rupees to play the Fishing Minigame.  He'll explain
the fishing process to you.

In order to win the Piece of Heart, you have to capture a record breaking fish:
nine pounds.  There really isn't much advice that can be given for this.  It's
all about patience.  Z-Target a fish, then hit B to cast.  Use the B button,
the A button and the joystick to play with the lure and attract fish to the
fly.  The biggest fish are found near the submerged log on the left side of the
pond and the reeds on the right.  Once a fish is on the line, hold down A and
pull backwards on the control stick to reel the fish in.  With that information
in hand, get fishing.

Once you have captured a nine-pound fish (minimum), return to the Clerk and
show him your fish.  He'll give you a Piece of Heart.  Leave the Fishing Pond.

Heart Piece #1 [HP33]
Goal: Reach the chest on top of Gerudo Fortress
Time Period: Adult Link ONLY
Requires: Longshot

Head to the top floor of Gerudo Fortress.  Look to the north side of the
fortress, where you will see the chest.  Use the Longshot to pull yourself over
to it.  Open the chest to get the Piece of Heart.

----------------------
Heart Piece #2 [HP34]
Goal: Score 1,000 or more points in Horseback Archery Minigame
Time Period: Adult Link ONLY
Requires: Fairy Bow; Epona Optional

The Gerudo Archery Range is by far the hardest shooting range in the game,
though if you managed to do the Big Poe Hunting sidequest then it shouldn't be
much of a problem.  You get twenty arrows to use, and in order to win the Piece
of Heart from this game you must score at least 1,000 points.  There are huge
wooden targets set up along the course as well pots that appear on the way.
Shoot the pots for 100 points each, and the targets are worth varying amounts
depending upon how close to the center you are (the exact middle of the target
is worth 100 points).

Epona will automatically run up and down the course (you get one pass in each
direction before the game ends).  On your first pass, focus on hitting the pots
as you pass by them.  Once you nail all the pots, focus on the target on the
far north side of the course.  On your second pass, shoot for the targets on
the east side of the course until you get near enough to accurately hit the
target on the south side of the course.  Once you do get near enough, aim for
it.  Once you score 1,000 points, you'll win the Piece of Heart.

In Kakariko Village, there is an old building which is filled with people who
are half-Hylian, half-Spider.  This is the House of Skulltula, and it's six
inhabitants are cursed.  If you find and destroy the one hundred Gold
Skulltulas around Hyrule, then you will free the family of it's curse.  You get
one reward for every ten Skulltulas that you kill, until you reach fifty
skulltulas.  At that point, you do not get another reward until you get all one
hundred.

The rewards are as follows:

---------------------------
10 Tokens - Adult's Wallet

The Adult's Wallet raises your rupee capacity from 99 rupees to 200 rupees.

-------------------------------
20 Tokens - The Stone of Agony

The Stone of Agony causes your Rumble Pak to Rumble when you near a hidden pit.

---------------------------
30 Tokens - Giant's Wallet

The Giant's Wallet raises your rupee capacity from 200 to 500 rupees.

---------------------
40 Tokens - Bombchus

Yep.  Lousy Bombchus.

---------------------------
50 Tokens - Piece of Heart

At 50, you get the best reward, a Piece of Heart.

------------------------
100 Tokens - Huge Rupee

Yep.  The ultimate reward for getting all 100 Gold Skulltulas is... 200 rupees.
Sort of.  You can keep leaving and re-entering the house, speaking with the
Patriarch again to get another 200 rupees.  This is kind of cool, if not for
the fact that by the time you reach this point of the game, infinite rupees is
about as useful as zero rupees.  But oh well.

Speak with the rather large and hairy clerk, and agree to play the game.  To
win the Big Bullet Bag, you have to shoot every rupee that appears without
missing a single one.  If you miss two or less, then the clerk will let you try
again for free.  If you miss more then two, you have to pay to play again.

For this first run through the Shooting Gallery, the rupees appear in a preset
order.  The order is:

1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Keep playing the minigame until you successfully shoot all of the targets, and
the clerk will award you with the Bullet Bag x40, which increases the ammo
capacity of your Slingshot by 10.  If you run out of rupees trying to complete
the game, then return to the Hyrule Castle Gatehouse and smash the pots to
replenish your supplies.

This shooting game is identical to the Shooting Gallery from Link's childhood,
only now the order is completely random.  Keep playing the game until you nail
all of the targets in one go, and the clerk will reward you with the first
Quiver upgrade.  Cherish it, as it will be the only Quiver upgrade you get
until almost the end of the game.

The order is as follows:
1.)  In the middle
2.)  From the left, then from the right
3.)  Jumps from the middle
4.)  From the left AND right
5.)  Two rupees coming from the right, going left
6.)  Two rupees coming from the left, going right

Note number 2: if a single blue rupee comes from the left, then the next one
will ALWAYS come from the right, despite the randomness of the rest of it.
Keep this in mind.  Also, if you memorize the patterns that the targets appear
in, then you can predict what will appear next, and you can always tell what
the last pattern will be by simply looking at what has already appeared.  Once
you have the quiver, return to Kakariko Village.

The Gerudo Archery Range is by far the hardest shooting range in the game,
though if you managed to do the Big Poe Hunting sidequest then it shouldn't be
much of a problem.  You get twenty arrows to use, and in order to win the Piece
of Heart from this game you must score at least 1,000 points.  There are huge
wooden targets set up along the course as well pots that appear on the way.
Shoot the pots for 100 points each, and the targets are worth varying amounts
depending upon how close to the center you are (the exact middle of the target
is worth 100 points).

Epona will automatically run up and down the course (you get one pass in each
direction before the game ends).  On your first pass, focus on hitting the pots
as you pass by them.  Once you nail all the pots, focus on the target on the
far north side of the course.  On your second pass, shoot for the targets on
the east side of the course until you get near enough to accurately hit the
target on the south side of the course.  Once you do get near enough, aim for
it.

Once you score 1,000 points, you'll win the Piece of Heart.  Play the game
again and score at least 1,500 to earn the Quiver.  If you score 1,500 or more
on your first attempt, then you have to play again to earn the Quiver and
repeat the feat.  Sorry, that's just how it works.  You don't get anything for
scoring a perfect 2,000, aside from a hearty pat on the back.

The object of Bombchu Bowling is to send the Bombchu (a mobile bomb) into the
hole on the opposite end of the course.  The course has three different goals
to obtain, each one becoming progressively more difficult.  Completing all
three goals successfully will win you whatever prize the clerk showed you at
the start.

For the first goal, the target is always in the center of the field.  Simply
stand in the exact middle of the field (slightly to the right of the center
arrow is the exact middle of the field) and time it so your Bombchu avoids the
Blade Trap.  The next level of the field can be on the top, left, or right, and
adds a small Cucco to dodge.  The Cucco isn't as predictable as the Blade Trap
in it's movements, but is so small it almost isn't an issue.  The last goal is
always in the exact center, and adds a Fat Cucco who always stands roughly in
the center of the field (but you can sneak a Bombchu by it if you're careful).

When you're playing Bombchu Bowling, always position yourself in the center of
the field.  The one exception is when the target appears on the right in the
second round; you have to minorly adjust your position to the left or right,
otherwise it's impossible to angle yourself properly for the Bombchu to enter
the target.  If the hole appears on the left side of the field, then adjust
your angle so that the Bombchu goes along the floor, then the wall, then into
the hole.  For holes in the center or top of the playing field, simply wait
until all of the targets are in the right position, and send a Bombchu straight
down the middle.  Absolutely never play anywhere except in the exact center of
the field (again, except for when the target appears on the right in the second
round).  Bombchu Bowling is, ultimately, more a game of patience and timing
then luck.

The Diving Minigame is relatively easy.  The Zora will throw a handful of
rupees off the waterfall, which you need to dive down and grab.  Simply
position yourself above the rupees, and hold down A as you dive down to grab
them.  Once you get better at it, you can grab multiple rupees in one dive.
Once you have grabbed all of the rupees from around the waterfall, the Zora
will call down for you to return to him and he'll give you a reward.  He'll
give you the Silver Scale, which doubles how deep you can go in a single dive.

There really isn't much advice that can be given for this.  It's all about
patience.  Z-Target a fish, then hit B to cast.  Use the B button, the A button
and the joystick to play with the lure and attract fish to the fly.  The
biggest fish are found near the submerged log on the left side of the pond and
the reeds on the right.  Once a fish is on the line, hold down A and pull
backwards on the control stick to reel the fish in.  With that information in
hand, get fishing.

Bigocto

The Bigocto is a really easy fight, it can just take some time to do it.  His
weakpoint is a large green "eye" on his backside.  The Bigocto is vulnerable to
the Boomerang - it stuns him and locks him in place.  To gain access to
Bigocto's backside, you must stun him with the Boomerang, then begin running
around to his backside by circling around the large platform in the middle of
the room.  After he recovers from the stun, the Bigocto will begin running in a
random direction.  If he begins to run towards you, then you'll have to stun
him again and start over.  If he runs in the same direction as you, then keep
circling until you reach his backside (it can take a while - try to hug as
close to the inner wall as you can).  Once you have reached his backside, stun
him with the Boomerang, and use a Jump Attack to damage his green eye.  Two
Jump Attacks will defeat the Bigocto.

Another alternative is to simply let him run into you.  He will then turn
around, letting you stun him and attack him.  This is less glamorous and
sloppier, but works much more quickly and easily.

Amy Poe

The final Poe Sister of the Forest Temple is Amy.  Amy is very different from
her sisters.  She will split into four different versions.  One is the real
Amy, the other three are fakes.  There are two different methods to finding the
real Amy.  The first, is to randomly shoot the different Poes until you hit the
real Amy.  The second, is just to pay attention.  The real Amy does a little
spin when she first splits up.  Shoot this Amy with an arrow, and she will
split into four new Amys.  Wait for the real Amy to spin, and shoot her again.
Amy doesn't really attack unless you give her the opportunity by taking too
long to shoot the real Amy.  Just stand still in the middle of the room while
the four Amys dance around you, and shoot when you get the chance.  It's okay
to Z-Target Amy; she doesn't disappear like her sisters.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Flare Dancer

These unique enemies aren't that hard, since they can be defeated without them
ever getting the chance to attack you.  If you have the Biggoron Sword, then
use it for a faster victory.

To damage the Flare Dancer, the first thing you must do is separate it's heart
from it's flaming body using the Hookshot.  Once this is done, the heart will
literally begin running around the room very quickly.  Begin circling the room
in the opposite direction so that you intercept it halfway around the room, and
use a jump attack to deal damage to it (use a regular strike if you have
difficulty timing the jump attack).

After a time, the Flare Dancer will jump back into the pillar of flames in the
middle of the room, and reignite his flaming body.  Steal his heart with the
Hookshot again, and the process starts over.  The Flare Dancer progressively
changes colors depending on how much damage he has taken.  When he sprouts
green flames, then he is nearly dead.  If the Flare Dancer does manage to get
off an attack, then he will create a bunch of tiny flames which will pursue you
around the room.  Not terribly dangerous.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Shadow Link

The first thing to know when fighting Shadow Link: do not perform a Stab attack
(forward + attack while Z-targeted).  It's tempting to use this attack a lot
(because let's face it, it works really well on most other enemies).  But
Shadow Link will just... well, you'll just have to see what he does.  In fact,
fighting Shadow Link with a Sword isn't really recommended at all.  Attacking
him with pretty much any basic sword attack will cause him to retaliate with
the exact same attack.  Pretend that Shadow Link and Hero Link's sword attacks
are magnets, each with the same polarity.  The same attacks will just deflect
one another.

So the trick is to use an attack with a negative polarity; i.e., an attack that
Dark Link can't perform.  This means using the Megaton Hammer.  He can't
deflect the Megaton Hammer.  He won't even try.  Just smack him around with it
until he dies.  Okay, a cool fight, but really easy and almost laughably
pointless.  If you're a combat purist and refuse to use such an easy tactic,
then the second-best way to beat him is to use regular sword attacks, but don't
Z-Target him.

-M-I-N-I--B-O-S-S-
Deadhand

Deadhand is relatively basic, and follows an easy pattern.  Allow one of his
hands to grab you, and Deadhand's body and head will appear and move slowly
towards you.  Struggle free of the hand holding you by rotating the control
stick and slamming buttons, then Z-Target Deadhand's head.  Stand still (out of
the range of the hands), and wait for Deadhand to get near you, at which point
his head will lower to attack.  Execute a Jump Attack before Deadhand can
attack, and he will begin to run away, eventually sinking back into the ground.
Allow another hand to grab you, and repeat the process until Deadhand dies.

Iron Knuckle

Iron Knuckles are tough, massive, and deal loads of damage.  You have two
methods of attack: either take the Stalfos method, by dodging the Iron Knuckles
relatively slow attacks, and then attacking in the aftermath of the Iron
Knuckles own attacks.  Or the easier, faster method is to just use Nayru's Love
and go kamikaze while you are invulnerable.  Even though you're invulnerable,
you can still be knocked around, so make some effort to avoid the Knuckle's
attacks.  If you choose the Stalfos method, then watch out for the Iron
Knuckle's ability to attack multiple times in a row.  If you run low on health,
then try to get the Iron Knuckle to knock over the pillars in the room, which
contain health and other items.  Once you whittle it down to half health, then
part of it's armor will break off and his movement and attack speed will
increase.  Don't bother blocking; it doesn't do much good against that massive
axe.

There's a trick you can perform with Adult Link to defeat an Iron Knuckle
relatively quickly and easily (it doesn't work very well with Young Link).
First, wait for the Iron Knuckle to attack, then backflip out of the attack's
range.  As soon as you land, use a Jump Attack, and then immediately backflip
out of the range of the Knuckle's next attack.  Use another Jump Attack,
backflip away, and repeat until the Knuckle is defeated.

Parasitic Armored Arachnid GOHMA

Fighting Gohma is actually very similar to fighting a gigantic Gohma Larva.
The only real tricks she has over these basic enemies is considerably more
health, the ability to climb walls, and the ability to create Gohma Larva to
distract you.  Defeating Gohma is rather easy (and can, in fact, be done by
only stunning her twice if you know how to do it properly).  To stun Gohma and
make her vulnerable to basic sword attacks, you must shoot her in the eye with
the Slingshot while her eye glows red.

As soon as the fight begins, immediately Z-target Gohma.  Gohma usually
immediately begins her charge attack, so immediately shoot her in the eye with
the Slingshot, then begin using Jump Attacks (remember to swing your sword at
least once before trying to do a jump attack).  After one or two attacks, Gohma
will run away and crawl up the ceiling.

Keeping Gohma Z-Targeted, try to keep yourself positioned so that you can see
her eye even while she is on the ceiling.  At this point she will begin
spawning Gohma Larva, who will drop down to fight you.  If you can shoot her in
the eye before she is able spawn them, however, then she will fall to the floor
and be stunned for a VERY long time.  You can easily get in three or four more
Jump Attacks at this point, which are more then enough to shut down Gohma
permanently.  If you miss, then kill the Gohma Larva, at which point the boss'
pattern resets.

----------B-O-S-S--------------
Infernal Dinosaur KING DODONGO

King Dodongo is a very easy boss (arguably easier then Gohma, but it's a
difficult argument).  He has two main phases; one, where he lumbers around the
room in a circle, and will breathe fire at you.  Two, where he rolls up into a
ball and ricochets around the room.  In order to damage him, you must wait for
him to begin inhaling in the first phase, and quickly throw a Bomb into his
mouth.  The bomb will explode in his stomach, stunning the King Dodongo for a
few seconds.  You are given only one sword swing when he is stunned, so make it
a Jump Attack.

After you have hurt Dodongo, he will begin his second phase.  Stand on the edge
of the lava or in one of the corners of the room to avoid his rolling attack.
After the King Dodongo rolls halfway around the room, he will revert to Phase
One, where the fight's pattern resets.  After three Jump Attacks or six normal
sword attacks, Dodongo will die.

-----------B-O-S-S------------
Bio-Electric Anemone BARINADE

Barinade is by no means a difficult boss, but he is the first boss in the game
who has a real chance at killing you.

In Barinade's first form, he is attached to the floor and ceiling by his roots
and tentacles.  His main attack in this form is to shoot bolts of lightning at
you with the "satellite dishes" on his head.  Z-Target the tentacles attached
to the ceiling, and begin circling the boss.  It doesn't matter what direction
you choose to circle in, but stick with it.  Changing course will result in you
getting electrocuted.  Destroy the tentacles attached to the ceiling with the
Boomerang.

Once you have destroyed the tentacles attached to the ceiling, the boss enters
phase two.  The Baris attached to Barinade's base will detach and begin
circling the boss in some kind of giant carousel.  Dodge through the circling
Biris, and stun the boss by striking it's base with the Boomerang.  The Baris
will release from their bonding to Barinade, and become vulnerable.  Destroy
them with your Boomerang.  After a short time, the Bari will reattach
themselves and begin circling again.  Repeat until all of the Bari are
destroyed.

The boss now enters phase three.  This is essentially the same as phase two,
except that the boss is now capable of moving about the room and the ring of
Baris is much smaller and faster.  Keep throwing your Boomerang at Barinade
until it can penetrate the fast moving Baris, and it will stun him.  Destroy
the Baris.  Be careful while destroying them, as the "satellite dishes" will
resume their attacking.

Once all of the Baris are dead, then you enter the boss' final phase, in which
you are finally able to damage him.  Stun him with your Boomerang, then run
into strike it's base with Jump Attacks.  Watch out, however - the satellite
dishes will keep on firing the whole time.  After two Jump Attacks, Barinade
will retreat into the ground briefly.  Keep dodging the Satellite Dishes until
he emerges from the ground, then resume stunning and damaging him.  After five
Jump Attacks, Barinade will be defeated.

---------------B-O-S-S----------------
Evil Spirit from Beyond PHANTOM GANON

At the start of the fight, Phantom Ganon will be mounted on a flying horse, and
will retreat into one of the paintings that encircle the room.  He will then
appear in two of the paintings, charging towards you down the path; one of them
is the real Phantom Ganon, the other is fake.  The fake one will turn back at
the last minute, the real one will emerge from the painting and scatter the
field with electricity.  To damage Phantom Ganon in this phase, you must shoot
him with an arrow as he emerges from the painting.  The real Phantom Ganon will
make the painting slightly brighter.  Even if you mess up and choose the fake
Ganon, then there is still enough time to change targets.

After you have shot Phantom Ganon three times in his first phase, then he will
enter his second phase.  If you have the Biggoron Sword, then switch to it now.
The Shield is worthless in this phase, and the Biggoron Sword's wider reach is
a significant advantage in this next part.

Phantom Ganon will now begin throwing balls of lightning at you.  To damage him
now, you must stun him by reflecting these lightning balls back at him using
sword strikes (if you're feeling silly, you can also use Bottles).  The ball
moves faster with each successive hit.  If you're feeling reckless, then you
can stand closer to Phantom Ganon.  This makes it harder to reflect shots, but
can get the fight over faster if you're good.  Conversely, you can stand on the
opposite end of the field to reflect the shots.  This is easier, and
recommended for newer or uncoordinated players.

Once the ball strikes Phantom Ganon, then he will be stunned briefly and fall
to the ground.  At this point, you should run in and begin pummeling him to
death with the Biggoron Sword (or Master Sword if you don't have the Biggoron
Sword yet).  Only do one Jump Attack, then proceed to regular strikes.  Doing
repeated Jump Attacks takes too long, and the close range may make several of
them miss.  Once Phantom Ganon recovers from the stun, then he returns to
throwing balls of lightning at you.  Repeat reflecting and attacking Phantom
Ganon until he is defeated.

-------------B-O-S-S--------------
Subterranean Lava Dragon VOLVAGIA

Volvagia isn't so much a Subterranean Lava Dragon as he is a Giant Flaming
Whack-A-Mole Dragon.  Nevertheless, this is one of the coolest and most
cinematic fights in the whole game, so enjoy it while you're here.  Jump out to
the large slab of rock in the middle of the cavern, and run to the middle of
the platform to begin the fight.

In Volvagia's first phase, he appears randomly in one of the nine pits that dot
the battlefield.  You'll know which pit he'll appear in, as a large amount of
smoke and cinders will appear around the pit.  Run towards this pit, and
Volvagia's head will emerge.  Smash his head with the Megaton Hammer (use a
Jump Attack with the Megaton Hammer for best results), and it will briefly stun
Volvagia.  At this point, you can get one more attack in on him.  So make it a
Jump Attack with the Biggoron Sword for best results (if you don't have the
Biggoron Sword, then the Megaton Hammer is a decent substitute).  If you take
too long to stun Volvagia, then he will attack you, and appear in a different
pit so you can try again.

In his second phase, Volvagia will emerge from one of the pits (again, you can
tell which ones by the smoke and cinders that appear around the pit) and fly
around the room, chasing you and trying to breath fire on you.  The easiest way
to avoid damage in this phase is to just run continuously to the left or right
in a small circle, preferably near the center of the battlefield.  After a
time, Volvagia will dive back into one of the pits and revert to his first
phase.  This time, however, he'll try to trick you by changing which pit he
comes out of just before he emerges.

After you damage Volvagia again, then he will emerge from the pits once more
and begin flying towards the ceiling.  The roof will begin to fall, raining the
battlefield with boulders.  Easily the best way to avoid this form of attack is
to just run to the edge of the battlefield and hang off the edge.  After the
boulders stop falling, then Volvagia will dive back into a pit in the ground,
and revert to his first phase, this time bouncing between even more pits before
finally emerging from one.  If Volvagia is not dead by this point, then he will
begin changing back and forth between Phase 2 and Phase 3, always alternating
back to Phase 1 so you can damage him.

----------B-O-S-S-----------
Giant Aquatic Amoeba MORPHA

I often hear this boss described as "hard."  I can only assume one of two
things: people assume that since the dungeon is fairly difficult and confusing,
then the boss must also be so.  The only other theory I can come up with (and
the one that I tend to favor) is that most people suck.  The only thing "hard"
about Morpha is it's ability to deal quite a large amount of damage in one
attack (which deal four to six hearts of damage... but since you should have
fourteen or fifteen heart containers by now, that's no big deal).

For the duration of this boss fight, it's very important that you avoid
entering the water, since this will give the boss easy opportunity to attack
you.  You should also avoid standing on the four platforms on the inside of the
room, since this will allow Morpha to attack you from several sides (this takes
more precedence later in the fight when Morpha has several arms to attack you
with), and also gives you very little room to move, making it even easier for
Morpha to grab you.  If you fall in the water or somehow end up on one of the
inner platforms, then get back to the perimeter of the room posthaste.  There
are ladders on the platforms in the middle of the room you can climb up if you
happen to fall in the water.

Morpha essentially has the same phase through the entire fight, where it will
attack you with it's arms.  The more damage the boss takes, the more arms
appear.  Morpha's "nucleus" (the large white brain/eye) will typically enter
one of these arms, and the arm will stretch out towards you.  If you make
contact with the arm, then it will grab you and hurl you into the wall.  Which
hurts about as much as you'd think it would.  Thankfully, your Longshot
outranges Morpha's arms by a considerable distance.  So stay a fair distance
away to avoid Morpha's only attack - it's arms.  You'll know Morpha is
generating another arm and is getting ready to attack when it spins around
rapidly in the water below.  After a while, it will spawn multiple arms.  These
arms rarely appear close enough together to box you in - unless, of course,
you're standing on the platforms in the middle of the room.  Which I already
told you to stay off of.

When Morpha enters one of it's arms, this is your opportunity to attack.  Grab
it with the Longshot, and it will remained stunned long enough for you to
attack it once, maybe twice.  Which is why you should make that attack a Jump
Attack with the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by now, no
excuses).  If you don't have the Biggoron's Sword, then a Jump Attack with the
Megaton Hammer will do.  After Morpha is damaged, it will bounce randomly
around the room for a little while, then return to the water and start spawning
more arms.  Continue attacking Morpha in this fashion until it dies.

Now if you're anything like me, you'll wonder how the hell people can find this
boss hard.

-------------B-O-S-S-------------
Phantom Shadow Beast BONGO BONGO

Pure evil has a name.  And that name is: Bongo Bongo.  Drop down the pit in the
middle of the room to begin the fight.

The entire boss fight is fought on a giant drum.  A giant Bongo Drum.  Yep,
that's right.  Bongo Bongo will attack you with his hands, or try to knock you
off the drum by pounding it hard.  Just use basic dodging to avoid these
attacks.  There's really no trick to it.  Just make sure you're using the
Kokiri Boots, otherwise this fight will be unnecessarily difficult.

To damage Bongo Bongo, you must make his eye appear.  To do this, shoot both of
his hands with arrows to stun them.  They recover quickly, so shoot fast.  Use
Z-Targeting; the hands move much too fast, and the constant movement of the
drum makes manual aiming pretty much impossible.  Once you stun both hands, use
the Lens of Truth to look at the space between the hands, and you'll see Bongo
Bongo's eye.  Shoot it with an Arrow as well, and Bongo Bongo's torso will fall
to the floor, letting you attack it.  As always, that attack should be a Jump
Attack from the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by now).  The
boss fight then resets.  Repeat until Bongo Bongo dies.  If you run low on
magic or arrows, Bongo Bongo's hands drop more when you stun them.

--------B-O-S-S------------
Sorceress Sisters TWINROVA

The Sorceress Sisters have two distinct phases, both of which are very fun and
very exciting.  This is possibly the best boss fight in the game, so enjoy it
while you're here.  The Sisters each have their own element which opposes the
other.  Kotake is Ice, and Koume is Fire.  The first thing to know when
fighting them in this phase is that Z-Targeting is not your friend, and having
your sword out is not necessary.

Run around the platform, and try to get both of the sisters in your range of
vision at the same time.  That's the key to this part of the fight; keeping
both of them visible.  This is why Z-Targeting is not helpful.  After a while,
one of them will begin charging up an attack (you'll know they're doing it as
weird shapes will appear in front of them while they cast the spell).  Very
quickly, a beam will appear.  You have to now use the Mirror Shield to reflect
this beam into the other sister, much as you reflected the beams of light
earlier in the dungeon.  It's not easy to do, and will indeed take much
practice.  Don't even TRY to Z-Target to aim the beam; if you do, the beam will
just fire off in some random direction and won't even get near the other
sister.  No other methods of attack work (though the Fire Arrows and Ice Arrows
seem like they should... but they don't).

If you fail to reflect one of the beams, then it will impact on the floor,
creating a ring that damages you (and in the case of Kotake's ice beam, freezes
you... which sucks).  For this reason, if you know you can't reflect the beam
into the other sister, reflect it anyway.  It's better then the alternative.
After you reflect a few beams into each of the Sisters, then the boss enters
it's next phase.

Now truly Twinrova, the Sorceress Sisters form one entity.  So you can now Z-
Target.  If you have the Biggoron Sword (which you can, and should, have by
now), then use it for this stage of the fight, but keep it "Put Away" until
you're ready to damage Twinrova.  To "Put Away" the Biggoron Sword, stand still
until the A-Button on the command menu reads Put Away.  Then press the A-
Button.  After you've attacked Twinrova, you want to put the Biggoron Sword
away again.  You can only Put Away when you are not Z-Targeted.  If all of this
is too much for you, just use the Master Sword

As Twinrova, the sisters gain the ability to fire both Fire and Ice.  In order
to stun Twinrova and make her vulnerable to attack, you have to absorb three
spells of the same alignment IN A ROW.  This means that, if you absorb two fire
spells, then an ice spell, then the two fires will be negated and you have to
absorb two more ice spells.  Near the start of this phase, Twinrova will
generally use three shots in a row of the same alignment.  But later on, she'll
start mixing things up.  For this reason, only hold down the R Button to absorb
attacks you actually want.  Otherwise, release the R Button and dodge the beams
(dodge twice to the right or left to avoid most beam attacks, but make sure you
don't dodge right off the ledge).  You can tell which beam Twinrova is about to
use by looking at which wand she waves - the right is Ice, the left is Fire.
You can also tell which beams your Mirror Shield has absorbed by looking at it
- it flashes red for fire, and white for ice.  The faster it flashes, the more
beams absorbed.

After you absorb three beams of the same alignment in a row, then the Mirror
Shield will unleash a massive beam back at Twinrova (keep the shield drawn to
make sure the beam connects).  This will stun her momentarily, causing her to
fall to the platform below her.  At this point, quickly equip the Hover Boots
and draw your sword.  Run out to Twinrova.  When you're halfway across the gap,
use a Jump Attack to go the rest of the way and damage Twinrova at the same
time.  Then switch to basic sword strikes.  When Twinrova recovers, return to
the main platform and switch back to the Kokiri Boots, where the second phase
starts over.  When returning to the main ledge, it helps if you momentarily
release the Z-Lock on Twinrova.  Repeat the above steps until Twinrova is dead.

---------B-O-S-S----------
King of Thieves GANONDORF

Navi is unavailable during this fight, meaning you can't Z-Target and she can't
give you advice with C-Up.  Once Ganondorf is stunned with a Light Arrow, then
Navi can Z-Target again, but Navi becomes unavailable once more when Ganondorf
recovers.

Those of you who liked the Phantom Ganon fight (which should be everyone) will
be very pleased to hear that this is very similar.  There are a few nuances to
this fight that are quite different, though.  For one, Ganondorf remains
stationary in the center of the room.  He also has a Shockwave attack, which
will collapse bits of the floor, creating pits that lead back down to the Tower
Floor Five area.  For this reason, don't go near Ganondorf until he is stunned,
or else he will use the Shockwave and make this fight more difficult then it
needs to be.

Ganondorf will throw balls of lightning at you, which you must reflect back at
him with sword strikes (or you can use Empty Bottles if you're feeling
creative).  If you miss a ball of lightning and it doesn't hit you, then it
will destroy whatever floor panel you happen to be standing on, knocking you
down to a lower floor.  You'll have to climb back up using the tiles on the
pillar in the middle of the room.

Ganondorf will reflect the balls back at you as well, so keeping reflecting
them until one strikes and stuns Ganondorf.  There is a new wrinkle to the
fight at this point; you must now shoot Ganondorf with a Light Arrow, whereupon
he will become stunned.  You can now Z-Target him.  Quickly equip the Hover
Boots and use them to cross the pit in the middle of the floor.  Just like in
the Twinrova fight, use a Jump Attack when you're halfway across the pit to
deal extra damage to him, then switch to normal attacks.  When Ganondorf
recovers, run back to the perimeter of the room and switch back to the Kokiri
Boots.

Ganondorf will occasionally use a new attack where he will charge up a lot of
power (you'll know when he's doing it, as he will hold up both arms to create
the spell instead of just one arm for the Lightning Ball).  To stop him from
using this attack, shoot him with a Light Arrow.  This will instantly stun him,
letting you get in more attacks.  As always, use the Biggoron Sword if you have
it.  Which you can, and should, have it by now.  Ganondorf's cape acts as his
life meter; the more tattered it becomes, the closer to death he is.  Once
Ganondorf is defeated, keep that controller ready - the game isn't over yet.

--B-O-S-S--
GANON

At the start of the fight you won't have access to the Master Sword.  Which
doesn't really matter, since Shields are useless against Ganon, and you should
have the Biggoron Sword by now.  If for whatever reason you don't have the
Biggoron Sword, then the Megaton Hammer will have to make due.  For this
ultimate showdown, Navi will be available for you to Z-Target Ganon, unlike in
the previous fight against him.

Like all evil demons of the underworld, Ganon's weakspot is his tail.  In his
first phase, you'll have to Z-Target Ganon and then begin performing side
dodges (hold right or left and press A) to speed around behind Ganon.  When you
get behind him, do a Jump Attack with the Biggoron Sword or Megaton Hammer to
deal a hefty amount of damage to Ganon.  After you hit his tail, he will raise
it up out of your reach.  Begin strafing around back to his front side, and his
tail will lower, letting you strafe back around to attack his tail again.
Repeat this method until a cutscene shows the flames around the perimeter of
the arena lowering.  Run over to Zelda and retake the Master Sword when this
happens.

If you have the Biggoron Sword, then stay with it for now.  If you were using
the Megaton Hammer as your weapon, then switch back to the Master Sword now.
Return to the Ganon to begin the final phase of the fight.  Your goal is still
the same: attack the evil fiend's tail.  Except now, you can't just strafe
around to it.  You have two options: shoot him in the face with a Light Arrow,
or release your Z-Target and roll between his legs.  Whichever path you choose,
once you are on his backside, Z-Target him and perform a Jump Attack on his
tail.  If you are using the Biggoron Sword, do ten or so Jump Attacks, then
switch to the Master Sword.  Only the Master Sword can defeat Ganon.  After a
cutscene, you will be prompted to attack Ganondorf while he is being held in
place by Zelda's magic.  Do this, and the game is over.  Too bad the final boss
wasn't that creative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How come Mido won't let me pass to the Deku Tree?  I have the Kokiri Sword
and Deku Shield.

A: Make sure you have them equipped in the Equipment subscreen.  If either the
Kokiri Sword or the Deku Shield is not equipped, then Mido will not let you
pass.

-----------------------------------------------
Q: What do those numbers on my game file mean?

A: I've heard all kinds of crazy explanations for this one, anything ranging
from experience levels to number of times you've completed the game.  The real
answer is, this number records the number of times you have seen the Game Over
screen on that file (deaths that were recovered with a Fairy don't count).

---------------------------------------------------------------
Q: Why can't I get the Deku Nut Upgrade from the Forest Stage?

A: This upgrade cannot be gotten if you have already become Adult Link.
Whether this is intentional or is a bug in the game is hard to say, but a bug
seems to make more sense.

--------------------------
Q: Where is the Triforce?

A: The Triforce is not a tangible object in the game.  When Link opens the Door
of Time in his childhood, then the Sacred Realm was unsealed.  The three shards
of the Triforce (Power, Courage and Wisdom) each went to a different person in
the world: Ganondorf got the Triforce of Power, Link got the Triforce of
Courage, and Zelda got the Triforce of Wisdom.  This is clearly shown at the
end of the game, when the different parts of the triforce shine on each
character's hand.

Anyone who says anything about a Sky Temple, Kaepora Gaebora, the purple tunic,
flying boots, etc. is a liar.  Anyone who believes them is a moron.

----------------------------------------------------------
Q: But I've seen pictures of Link obtaining the Triforce!

A: Yes, and Link's Hylian Shield also looks very different, and his character
model is practically a skeletal frame.  It's clearly a picture from a beta
version of the game.  Anyone who can't see that right from the start is a
moron.

------------------------------------
Q: How do I unfreeze Zora's Domain?

A: Short answer: you can't.

Long answer: Zora's Domain begins to unfreeze after you beat the Water Temple.
However, it doesn't just happen overnight.  Ganondorf trapped Zora's Domain in
it's own private ice age.  Ice takes time to melt.  The more of it there is,
the more time it takes.  Zora's Domain unfreezes eventually.  We know this, as
Zoras appear in the party at Lon Lon Ranch during the credits.

------------------------------------------------------
Q: I'm missing nine Gold Skulltulas.  Where are they?

A: The nine most commonly missed Gold Skulltulas are the nine hidden in the
patches of soft earth through Hyrule.  As Young Link, travel to the patches of
soft earth (Kokiri Forest, Lake Hylia, Gerudo Valley, Death Mountain Trail,
Death Mountain Crater, Kakariko Graveyard, Desert Colossus, and two in the Lost
Woods) and drop a Bottled Bug into the patch.  Each of the patches will produce
a Gold Skulltula.  For whatever reason, the patch of soft earth at Zora's River
does not contain a Gold Skulltula.

---------------------------------------------------------
Q: How come I can't sell the Skull Mask to the Skullkid?

A: He will only buy the mask from you if you've already played him Saria's Song
and earned the Piece of Heart.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: What's the point of climbing the Windmill in Kakariko Village?

A: If you don't know what this guy is talking about... you can use the Longshot
to access hidden openings in the Kakariko Village Windmill.  These openings do
nothing.  They are probably a leftover bit from something that was taken out of
the game, possibly a fight against Bongo Bongo when he attacks Kakariko
Village.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Q: How do I get across the pit of lava on the east side of Goron City?

A: You need both the Longshot and the Song of Time to get across the pit.  Play
the Song of Time to make a Block of Time appear, then stand on the block to use
the Longshot and pull yourself across the lava pit.  What's on the other side?
A pit containing Business Scrubs, selling rubbish.

Q: How do you beat the Running Man?

A: As Adult Link, you can challenge the Running Man who bought your Bunny Hood
as a child to a footrace from the Gerudo Valley Carpenter's Tent to the
entrance to Kokiri Forest.  It doesn't matter how fast you go, he'll always
beat you by exactly one second.  The developers of the game have been
reportedly "very amused" by the fact that we silly Americans have not, I quote,
"Been able to figure that out yet."  What we haven't been able to figure out is
anyone's guess (they aren't terribly specific).  It could mean that we haven't
figured out how to beat him yet, or still haven't figured out that you can't
beat him (given that new rumors pop up almost daily on how to beat him).

In the end, it seems that all the Running Man is a time trial to see how
quickly you can travel from Gerudo Valley to Kokiri Forest.  He does, after
all, keep track of your best time.  Originally some kind of reward may have
been involved in this challenge, but just as with the hidden passage in the
Kakariko Windmill, this reward has been removed.

Q: What is the "Gold Skulltula Trick?"

A: This trick lets you get unlimited Gold Skulltula tokens, even past the 100
mark (the Quest Subscreen even shows the number going above 100).  To perform
this trick, head for the pit in Hyrule Castle Garden which can only be opened
with the Song of Storms.  It's near the tree in the area with Talon's Milk
Crates.  Drop down into the pit, and look for the Gold Skulltula.  Kill it, and
then Z-Target its token.  Use the Boomerang on the token, and then backflip
into the beam of light leading back to the surface just before the Token
touches you.  If you do it right, then you'll get credit for the token, and the
Skulltula will still be in the pit.  You can repeat this as many times as you
like.
